4931,Couldn't open CUDA library libcuda.so.1 in when building using nvidia docker cuda8 image,"We built tensorflow on nvidia-docker image nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn5-devel
""""""
However, when using the package we built, we run into this problem:
I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:105] Couldn't open CUDA library libcuda.so.1. LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64:
""""""
In this special Dockerfile, we are using whatever LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined by nvidia docker.

It looks like we are looking specificly for the file libcuda.so.1
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc#L80

And it looks like we switched to doing this due to:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/2865

However, libcuda.so.1 is not linked/made available by nvidia-docker in the docker image.

Side note: it seems to be not available in our docker images based on 7.5, but that one somehow works.
No idea how.

@flx42 could you help us shed some light into this?

4922,Android: read model file from arbitrary directory rather than from assets folder,"Currently, TensorFlowInferenceInterface's method initializeTensorFlow() and its underlying C implementation (in tensorflow_inference_jni.cc and jni_utils.cc) require the usage of Android's AssetManager in order to read model files stored in the assets folder. 

How can we modify TF's code to provide an alternative way to run the classification using a model file that's not stored in the assets folder (i.e. a location described by a File object, or by a String path pointing to another location outside the assets folder).

Is there branch where someone might be working on this? I have poor C skills so as to make such change by myself, but maybe I can work on something with some guidance.

Thanks.

4921,FileSystem::GetMatchingPaths doesn't work for simple pattern,"With latest tensorflow.

``` bash
$ ls
test
```

``` cpp
std::vector<string> results;
auto ret = tensorflow::Env::Default()->GetMatchingPaths(""te*"", &results);
cout << results.size() << endl;  // 0
ret = tensorflow::Env::Default()->GetMatchingPaths(""./te*"", &results);
cout << results.size() << endl;  // 1
```

Reason:
In the implementation of `GetMatchingPaths` [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/file_system.cc#L94), when the pattern doesn't contain any directory, the prefix `.` is prepended to all elements in `all_files`, and then `MatchPath(""./test"", ""te*"")` evals to false.
"
4920,Better support for initializing variables that depend on each other,"Currently there's no easy way to properly initialize variables when some variables initial values depend on other variables, and initialization has to be split over several `.run` calls. This kind of initialization happens with data-dependent parameter init.

This could be solved if there were something like `var.initialized_value()`, but which only runs initializer if the variable hasn't been initialized already.

Example:

```
a = tf.get_variable(""a"", shape=())
b = tf.get_variable(""b"", initializer=a.initialized_value())
c = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=())
d = tf.get_variable(""d"", initializer=a.initialized_value()+c)

sess.run([a.initializer, b.initializer])
sess.run([d.initializer], feed_dict={c: 0})
sess.run([a, b, d])

Out[]: [0.30858743, -1.2756943, 0.30858743]
```

Here, `a` and `b` end up with different values because initializer for `a` has been run twice, which is counter-intuitive, the user expects `a,b,d` to have same values
"
4917,QueueRunner deadlock when using all CPUs,"I'm building an input pipeline following the guidelines [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/how_tos/reading_data/index.html).  The pipeline needs to queue up a bunch of input examples, process each example using a python function (inserted into the tensorflow computation graph using `tf.py_func`), and return the processed results to an output queue.  I'd like to use `QueueRunner`'s ability to process multiple examples in parallel by launching one processing thread per CPU core.  Here's a simplified example of what I'm trying to do:

``` python
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing
import tensorflow as tf

n_cpus = multiprocessing.cpu_count()

sess = tf.Session()
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
mult = tf.mul(a, b)

def python_op(x):
    print ""python_op called with {}"".format(x)
    # In my real function, the np.cos and np.sin calls are replaced by
    # python calculations I can't do in tensorflow
    y = np.cos(x)
    z = sess.run(mult, feed_dict={a: y, b: x})
    print ""intermediate result is {}"".format(z)
    return np.sin(z)

n_inputs = n_cpus
input_queue = tf.FIFOQueue(10000, [tf.float32], shapes=[1])
load_input = input_queue.enqueue_many(np.random.random((n_inputs, 1)))

output_queue = tf.FIFOQueue(10000, [tf.float32], shapes=[1])
get_result = output_queue.dequeue_many(n_inputs)

def processing_pipeline():
    input_value = input_queue.dequeue()
    return output_queue.enqueue(tf.py_func(python_op, [input_value], [tf.float32], False))

# Here's the problem: If we use all CPUs here, the program will deadlock.
# If we change cpus to (cpus-1), it works as expected.
runner = tf.train.QueueRunner(output_queue, [processing_pipeline()] * (n_cpus))

coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
runner.create_threads(sess, coord=coord, start=True)

print ""Loading input""
sess.run(load_input)
sess.run(input_queue.close())

try:
    print ""waiting for result""
    result = sess.run(get_result)
    print ""RESULT: {}"".format(result)
except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
    print ""Input exhausted""

coord.request_stop()
coord.join()
print ""Done""
```

The program above deadlocks waiting for `sess.run` to complete in `python_op`:

```
$ python queuetest.py

This is running on an 8-core machine; you can see that 8 `python_op`s are currently running but are failing to finish.  If, however, we don't use all CPUs (by changing `(n_cpus)` to `(n_cpus-1)` in the line that creates the `tf.train.QueueRunner`, then the program runs to completion:

The program also completes successfully if we pass in fewer examples than CPUs in the input queue.

I realize it's somewhat awkward for `python_op` to call back into the tensorflow session.  However, the [threading and queues](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/how_tos/threading_and_queues/index.html#threading-and-queues) section of the manual states:

""The TensorFlow Session object is multithreaded, so multiple threads can easily use the same session and run ops in parallel.""

So, I assumed that the use case I've outlined above should be supported, and it seems surprising that it works in some cases (fewer threads than CPUs) and doesn't in others (one thread per CPU).  Is this a bug, or is there some reason I shouldn't expect it to work?

As a side note, one option to work around my problems would be to break `python_op` into several smaller pieces and chain the intermediate results together in the tensorflow computation graph.  However, in my real pipeline, this isn't straightforward to do, since `python_op`'s real output depends on a number of intermediate, native python data structures that aren't easily converted into tensors that could be spliced into the tensorflow graph.

4914,Keeping gradient of sqrt(x) stable for x = 0,"I'm minimizing a function that contains a few `tf.sqrt(c * x)` terms. The `x` is a `tf.Variable` and `c` is a `tf.constant` that is sometimes zero. A `NaN` inevitably presents itself. In my case, the gradient is to `c`, which is `x * 0.5/sqrt(c * x)` and which equals `0 * inf = NaN` when `c` is `0`.

When such a `sqrt` is deeply buried in your function, it can be quite an effort to dig out where the `NaN` is coming from. I can understand and appreciate the fact that there is no check for zero in the `sqrt_grad` operator. However, I feel that debugging could be easier for ops that are known to be unstable in some numerical range.

Two possible fixes would be:
1. Add exceptions to the documentation of these ops. Right now this is not even indicated for `tf.div`, for instance. Since the use-cases of TensorFlow almost always mean that gradients will be involved, the allowed range should also be mentioned for the gradient, if different from that of the op itself.
2. Add debug-mode versions of the ops. These could include `NaN` and `inf` checks.

By the way, I was using the `tf.contrib.opt.ScipyOptimizerInterface` for the minimization, which does not support manually changing the gradients by using `compute_gradients` and `apply_gradients`. That's beside the point, though.

Below some example code for completeness' sake. The differences in outcome only add to the confusion.

``` python
from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function
import tensorflow as tf

c = tf.Variable(0.0)

sqrt_grad = tf.gradients(tf.sqrt(c), c)

# another possibility is when another factor in the argument is zero
x = tf.Variable(1.)
sqrt_x_grad = tf.gradients(tf.sqrt(x * c), x)

# try to use select to filter out the NaN
selsqrt_grad = tf.gradients(tf.select(c > 0, tf.sqrt(c), 0), c)

4906,"The ""cos"" merge mode when using tf as backend cann't get the expect result","I have two batch of sentences as inputs, like:

```
a = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0,1,0,0,0]], dtype='int32')
b = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0,0,2,0,0]], dtype='int32')
vec = model.predict([a, b])
```

In my model, I trying to get the cos score between two vector, so I use 'cos' model in merge
`cos_score = merge([vec_a, vec_b], mode='cos', dot_axes=1)`
When I use theano as backend, it works fine, but when I use tf as backend, the output_shape=[batch_size, batch_size]

The result by 'tf' backend:

```
[[ 0.99999994  0.97052568]
 [ 1.0303694   0.80238068]]
```

The result by 'theano' backend:

```
[[ 1.        ]
 [ 0.80238068]]
```

This is caused by [tf.batch_matmul](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/functions_and_classes/shard5/tf.batch_matmul.md), 

> The input tensors x and y are 3-D or higher

But I just input 2-D vectors. I think it have to be expanded when the input shape is 2-D

BTW, My solution is:

```
if (keras.backend.backend() == ""theano""):
    cos_score = merge([vec_a, vec_b], mode='cos', dot_axes=1)
else:
    vec_a = RepeatVector(1)(vec_a)
    vec_b = RepeatVector(1)(vec_b)
    cos_score = merge([vec_a, vec_b], mode='cos', dot_axes=2)
    cos_score = Flatten()(cos_score)
```

4904,is the documentation about sampled_softmax_loss correct?,"Hi, 
""tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(weights, biases, inputs, labels, num_sampled, num_classes, num_true=1, sampled_values=None, remove_accidental_hits=True, partition_strategy='mod', name='sampled_softmax_loss')""
the document says:
""At inference time, you can compute full softmax probabilities with the expression tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights)) + biases).""

I am not sure if this describes the behavior correctly. First, the labels are not used in the softmax computation; Second, the weights matrix is merely a lookup table that maps each word to a vector (word2vec), the above matmul operation is not meaningful.

Here is my understanding of the code:
Given any word w, we have a vector encoding V1 from inputs, and then with label, we look up the weight matrix to find a vector encoding V2. Then we compute the softmax loss (cross-entropy loss) between V1 and V2. Finally, we sum up the loss for the sampled words.

4898,Dequeue op loses TensorShape,"I am not able to find related issues online.

Operating System:
Ubuntu, Mac OSX

Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: 
CUDA 7.5, cuDNN v5.1

If installed from binary pip package, provide:
1. A link to the pip package you installed:
`TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl`
2. The output from `python -c ""import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)""`.
`I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcublas.so locally`
`I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so locally`
`I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcufft.so locally`
`I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcuda.so.1 locally`
`I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:111] successfully opened CUDA library libcurand.so locally`
`0.11.0rc0`

To reproduce the problem:

`a = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[None, 10])`
`print a.get_shape()`
`queue = tf.FIFOQueue(20, dtypes=[tf.int32])`
`queue.enqueue([a])`
`b = queue.dequeue()`
`print b.get_shape()`

The first print output <?, 10>, which is OK, and there is a TensorShape for a.
But the second print output is <unknown>, and there is no TensorShape for b.

TensorShape information is lost after dequeue operation.

And this TensorShape is required in LSTM cell class.

Can we add this TensorShape information back to the dequeued tensors?

Thanks.

4897,Provide unaggregated gradients tensors,"As described here, TF is inflexible when it comes to access to the gradients:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35731506/unaggregated-gradients-gradients-per-example-in-tensorflow?rq=1

Please provide a method where the user can retrieve the raw gradients, not the averaged gradients. Requiring the user to compute their own gradients is impractical -- the framework should work for the user, not the other way around.

Use case: this is needed for reinforcement learning, where the gradients of one net needs to be backpropagated through another net (in separate steps).

4893,How to create `input_fn` using `read_batch_examples` with `num_epochs` set?,"TF Version: 0.10.0rc
## Update

Solved the issue, see [StackOverflow post here for solution](http://stackoverflow.com/q/39877710/6557588).
## Original non-Issue...

I have a basic `input_fn` that can be used with Tensorflow Estimators below. It works flawlessly without setting the `num_epochs` parameter; the obtained tensor has a discrete shape. Pass in `num_epochs` as anything other than `None` results in an unknown shape. My issue lies with constructing sparse tensors whilst using `num_epochs`; I cannot figure out how to generically create said tensors without knowing the shape of the input tensor.

Can anyone think of a solution to this problem? I'd like to be able to pass `num_epochs=1` to be able to evaluate only 1 time over the data set, as well as to pass to `predict` to yield a set of predictions the size of the data set, no more no less.

``` python
    def input_fn(batch_size):
        examples_op = tf.contrib.learn.read_batch_examples(
            FILE_NAMES,
            batch_size=batch_size,
            reader=tf.TextLineReader,
            num_epochs=1,
            parse_fn=lambda x: tf.decode_csv(x, [tf.constant([''], dtype=tf.string)] * len(HEADERS)))

        examples_dict = {}
        for i, header in enumerate(HEADERS):
            examples_dict[header] = examples_op[:, i]

        continuous_cols = {k: tf.string_to_number(examples_dict[k], out_type=tf.float32)
                           for k in CONTINUOUS_FEATURES}

        # Problems lay here while creating sparse categorical tensors
        categorical_cols = {
            k: tf.SparseTensor(
                indices=[[i, 0] for i in range(examples_dict[k].get_shape()[0])],
                values=examples_dict[k],
                shape=[int(examples_dict[k].get_shape()[0]), 1])
            for k in CATEGORICAL_FEATURES}

        feature_cols = dict(continuous_cols)
        feature_cols.update(categorical_cols)
        label = tf.string_to_number(examples_dict[LABEL], out_type=tf.int32)

        return feature_cols, label

I saw the [comment](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/math_grad.py#L71) for reduce_max and it seems like the first one is feature.

4883,Ability to directly set the gradient of a node for use in backpropagation.,"Imagine a tiny network defined as follows, where linear is a typical helper function defining TensorFlow variables for a weight matrix and activation function:

`final_layer = linear(linear(_input,10,tf.nn.tanh),20)`

Normally this would be optimized via gradient descent on a loss:

`loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(final_layer - _target))
train_step = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimmize(loss)`

But assume I'm getting the derivatives of the loss w.r.t. final_layer from an external  source (e.g. a tf.placeholder named _deriv). I would like to be able to use this gradient information with one of the builtin optimizers to backpropagate and update the network parameters, but this appears to be currently impossible.

The workaround I'm currently using is to construct an artificial loss consisting of the inner product between _deriv and final_layer (since the derivatives of this loss w.r.t. final_layer will be equal to _deriv). 

`loss = tf.reduce_sum(final_layer*_deriv)
train_step = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimmize(loss)`

This is very wasteful though, as it needs to do this unnecessary inner product and calculate its derivative for every training step even though I already know this information.

For those thinking this an odd thing to need to do, it is necessary for implementing [synthetic gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343).

4882,S_IREAD and S_IWRITE errors from gif_archive in CentOS 6.8 Build,"Hi there,

I've been attempting off and on for the last 1-2 weeks to get Tensorflow to build on CentOS 6.8. I've spent a lot of time reading through old issues and piecing/hacking together suggestions from developers and other users on how to configure the build. I'm using a hand-built version of GCC (v. 4.9.3) in a non-default location with the system version of binutils (more info below). 

I've managed to get the tutorial_trainers_example to build and run successfully, but I'm now running into trouble when attempting to build the pip wheel (see below). It looks like there may be some missing header files.
### Relevant Threads

The most helpful threads I've found during this process have been the following:

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/110 (especially comments from @rdipietro)
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/760 (thanks @damienmg)

The only mention I can find of the specific error (granted, for a completely different platform) is in this recent Stackoverflow thread:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39855672/tensorflow-how-to-compile-libtensorflow-cc-so-for-android

The fact that this is a recent thread makes me think that perhaps there was some sort of error that was introduced into the build config in the last few weeks/months.

### Custom Build Config for Bazel & Tensorflow

For the bazel build:
- Modified `tools/cpp/CROSSTOOL` to point to C and C++ compilers in non-default locations 
- Added an extra `linker_flag` line in `tools/cpp/CROSSTOOL`
- Added a bunch of `cxx_builtin_include_directory` lines to point to all the appropriate header files within GCC 4.9.3 in `tools/cpp/CROSSTOOL` 

For the Tensorflow build:
- Modified `third_party/gpus/crosstool/CROSSTOOL.tpl` to point to C++ compiler in custom location 
- Added an extra `linker_flag` line to `third_party/gpus/crosstool/CROSSTOOL.tpl` 
- Updated `third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc.tpl` to point to the versions of NVCC and GCC that are in non-default locations 
- Commented out the line `cmd = 'PATH=' + PREFIX_DIR + ' ' + cmd` in `third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc.tpl` (otherwise `as` cannot be found). 

I can provide the exact lines I used if you'd like. Just let me know.

4880,Needed to install `pbr` and `funcsigs`,"I was following the [Pip Installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation) instructions.  When I ran the [Test the TensorFlow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#test-the-tensorflow-installation) steps, I hit two errors, listed below.
### The Fix!

To fix, I ran `pip install pbr funcsigs`, then the test Python program worked.
### Environment info

Operating System: Mac OSX 10.10.5

If installed from binary pip package, provide:
1. A link to the pip package you installed:
   I installed this one:

```
# Mac OS X, CPU only, Python 2.7:
$ export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-py2-none-any.whl
```
1. The output from `python -c ""import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)""`.

```
0.11.0rc0
```
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

I was following the existing instructions, I don't _think_ I missed any steps...
### Logs or other output that would be helpful

Here are the two errors that I saw:

1)

Thoughts?  @benoitsteiner

I think it's a bug and caused by the update of `tf.Session()`.
I hope I can fix it ASAP

4865,GraphDef duplication in event log,"This is a little difficult to explain, and I'm guessing someone has to have run into it before, but it would be nice to at least get an explanation for what's going on here.

The issue I'm finding is that when you specify a `model_dir` argument for any tflearn model, the first time you fit that model, the tensorboard warning like the following will always appear:

`WARNING:tensorflow:Found more than one graph event per run. Overwriting the graph with the newest event.`

If you clear the contents of that directory and rerun the same model, the warning no longer appears.

For example, here is a piece of code to reproduce:

```
import tensorflow as tf
import random

from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python import learn
from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn import datasets
from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators._sklearn import accuracy_score
from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators._sklearn import train_test_split
random.seed(42)

iris = datasets.load_iris()
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data,
                                                    iris.target,
                                                    test_size=0.2,
                                                    random_state=42)

def custom_optimizer(learning_rate):
    return tf.train.MomentumOptimizer(learning_rate, 0.9)

classifier = learn.TensorFlowDNNClassifier(
    hidden_units=[10, 20, 10],
    n_classes=3,
    steps=400,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    optimizer=custom_optimizer,
    model_dir='/tmp/tf/bug_test_1')
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

If you run this in a jupyter notebook, wait until it is done, cd into `/tmp/tf/bug_test_1`, and run `tensorboard --logdir=.`, the warning will appear.  If you clear the contents and run again, it will no longer appear.  If you, in the same notebook within the same kernel, change the directory to something else (e.g. `/tmp/tf/bug_test_2`) and run again, the warning will again appear.  And the warning will again go away if you clear the contents and run again with the same directory.

I also tried pre-creating the directory but that appears to make no difference.

I wouldn't imagine this indicates a major problem but I try to take those warnings seriously since they have indicated more problematic issues in the past with running multiple models in the same kernel, so it would be great to know what this means.

4863,iOS error: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Mul' with these attrs [T=DT_INT32],"I have some issues performing a multiplication of int32 data on iOS. Session::Run fails with the error shown below, indicating that this particular multiplication op is not supported. I've already checked tf_op_files.txt, and 'tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_mul.cc' is there, obviously, and it looks to like the int32 version should also get registered there.

Do I need to take any extra steps to enable int32 multiplication on iOS?

This is the exact error message I'm getting:

```
No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'Mul' with these attrs
     [[Node: mul = Mul[T=DT_INT32](Cast, Cast)]]
```

I'm using TensorFlow 0.10. Here is how I create the graph def file in Python:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util

input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1,4), name='input')

v = tf.cast(input, tf.int32)
v = v * v
output = tf.cast(v, tf.float32, name='output')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(sess, sess.graph_def, ['output'])

with tf.gfile.GFile('/tmp/test_graph.pb', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())
```

An example in the code base does not work with the docker image. It is the opinion of the filer that all examples should run without any need for configuration on the docker image because the project has control over what is installed on the docker image.

4859,incorrect gradient for complex matmul,"The `MatMul` kernel is registered for `complex64` and `complex128` on CPU and GPU. However the gradient is incorrect. This issue has not been caught because there is no test for a complex-valued `MatMul` gradient in `tensorflow\python\kernel_tests\matmul_op_test.py`.

When computing the complex gradient we need to apply the conjugate of the input. Several cwise gradient ops in TF were ignoring this step until it was addressed by @girving and @tensorflower-gardener in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/821063df9f0e6a0eec8cb78cb0ddc5c5b2b91b9f. However it seems that `MatMul` snuck through the cracks.

**To Reproduce**

``` python
ops.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.Session()
x = (np.linspace(-3, 3, 6) + 1j*np.linspace(3, -3, 6)).reshape(3, 2)
y = (np.linspace(-3, 3, 8) + 1j*np.linspace(3, -3, 8)).reshape(2, 4)
with sess.as_default():
    with tf.device('/cpu'):
        x_tf = tf.constant(x, dtype=tf.complex64, name=""x"")
        y_tf = tf.constant(y, dtype=tf.complex64, name=""y"")
        m = tf.matmul(x_tf, y_tf, name=""matmul"")
        err = tf.test.compute_gradient_error(x_tf, [3, 2], m, [3, 4])
        print(err)

with sess.as_default():
    with tf.device('/gpu'):
        x_tf = tf.constant(x, dtype=tf.complex64, name=""x"")
        y_tf = tf.constant(y, dtype=tf.complex64, name=""y"")
        m = tf.matmul(x_tf, y_tf, name=""matmul"")
        err = tf.test.compute_gradient_error(x_tf, [3, 2], m, [3, 4])
        print(err)
```

``` python
>>> 6.00002098083
>>> 6.00002098083
```

**Proposed Fix**
Replace [these lines](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/math_grad.py#L697-L714) with:

``` python
@ops.RegisterGradient(""MatMul"")
def _MatMulGrad(op, grad):
  with ops.control_dependencies([grad.op]):
      inp0 = math_ops.conj(op.inputs[0])
      inp1 = math_ops.conj(op.inputs[1])
      t_a = op.get_attr(""transpose_a"")
      t_b = op.get_attr(""transpose_b"")
      if not t_a and not t_b:
        return (math_ops.matmul(grad, inp1, transpose_b=True),
                math_ops.matmul(inp0, grad, transpose_a=True))
      elif not t_a and t_b:
        return (math_ops.matmul(grad, inp1),
                math_ops.matmul(grad, inp0, transpose_a=True))
      elif t_a and not t_b:
        return (math_ops.matmul(op.inp1, grad, transpose_b=True),
                math_ops.matmul(op.inp0, grad))
      elif t_a and t_b:
        return (math_ops.matmul(op.inp1, grad, transpose_a=True,
                                transpose_b=True),
                math_ops.matmul(grad, op.inp0, transpose_a=True,
                                transpose_b=True))
```

and add a complex gradient test to `tensorflow\python\kernel_tests\matmul_op_test.py`.

4853,Windows version of Tensorflow won't compile,"@mrry 
Thank you for your great work for the windows version of tensorflow. I've tried to build tensorflow on windows based on your tensorflow CMake build guide.  The only difference is that I didn't use anaconda. 

I've tried to build the tf_tutorials_example_trainer target. However it seems to depend on gif and png target, which are not able to get built. 

For the gif target, it seems to be invoking a configure shell script which is not able to be executed in windows cmd. The error reads like:

4849,"Method docs contain unclosed verbatim, which causes exceeding verbatim block in HTML docs","The HTML docs for `tf.constant_initializer` at  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/state_ops.html#constant_initializer contain unclosed verbatim block, which continues past the method and contains several following methods -- see for example the `tf.random_normal_initializer`.

I am not much familiar with the process of documentation generation, but my guess is that the verbatim ending block at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/2c4af2e65a2018540d949cfdba1fcb15d0121f80/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py#L142 has wrong indentation (it is indented by two more spaces than the start of the block).

David, Damien, looks like bazel clean undid some output of ""./configure"" at head.
Any idea where things went wrong?

4847,input tensor lost in --mode eightbit quantization,"Quantizing with --mode eightbit somehow loses the input tensor, whereas other methods like weights_rounded don't. If I do this:

`python quantize_graph.py --input ~/proc/frozen_inference_optimized.pb --output ~/proc/frozen_inference_optimized_quantized.pb --output_node_names on_logits --mode eightbit`

the following error pops up in the iOS tensorflow runtime:

`Running model failed:Not found: FeedInputs: unable to find feed output preprocess/centered_bgr`

Here `preprocess/centered_bgr` is the node I want to use as the input. If instead I use something like `--mode weights_rounded` no error is raised and the network functions as expected.

4836,ZeroMQ Operator,"Currently (it seems like) the encouraged way to read data is either through the provided reader/producer ops which are not quite flexible, or through python feed_dict which is slower.

Is there a plan to support something like a ZeroMQReaderOp, which keeps reading and deserializing tensors from a zmq socket and produce them? This way we can use any comfortable way to process data perhaps in an independent process, and send them through zmq for training.

4833,Slow IDCT used in JPEG decode,"This issue is related to #4807, yet a bit distinct. Regardless of whether libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo is used, I was wondering if there was a reason to choose the slow but more accurate variant of IDCT in libjpeg ([code link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6b1d4fd8090d44d20fdadabf06f1a9b178c3d80c/tensorflow/core/lib/jpeg/jpeg_mem.cc#L143)). For human image viewing pleasure, accuracy may matter, but I was wondering if for model training, the decision was made to use the slower IDCT because that improved model convergence? In case the training is immune to using the faster but less accurate IDCT, it may be worth changing the default. Has anyone done any studies as to the trained model impact of the faster IDCT? From a performance point of view, I'm getting a significant performance gain (2x GTX 1080, 6-core high-clock Core i7, 500 MB/s SSD), around 20% for AlexNet against precomputed ImageNet AlexNet may be more CPU bound for decode since the network passes themselves are relatively cheap, so maybe the gains for Inception v3 or ResNet would be less, but they would still likely be significant.

4816,tensroflow 0.11rc conflict with boost.python generated so,"My application will use both tensorflow and some so generated by boost.python(1.53) running on centos 6.3 with cuda 7.5 and cudnn 4 .
The problem is everything is fine with tensorflow 0.10, but changing to tensorflow 0.11rc, then 
I will always face segmentation fault (double free) before the program stop running, especially if using numpy also, and if changing import library sequence  might decrease the chance of facing double free, but still not fully solve the problem.

4814,[Feature Request] Make streaming metrics resettable,"Hi! 
Currently, the streaming metrics are (as far as I know) not resettable. I'd like to be able to e.g. reset the counter after each epoch. This way, having e.g. a very bad accuracy in the beginning of training will not still influence the accuracy value ten epochs later. It makes it easier to compare my results to runs obtained outside tensorflow.

The only workaround I found is to do `sess.run(tf.initialize_local_variables())` after each epoch, but of course this can have bad side effects if I have other local variables that I don't want to reset.

Or is there a way to achieve what I want that I didn't think of?

4809,Getting Send/Recv timings for distributed TF,"I'm trying to troubleshoot some slowness in our distributed models , and it would be useful to have access to timing of Send/Recv ops across graph partition.

cc @suharshs because maybe StatsPublisherInterface is relevant?

For instance, a toy benchmark [here](https://gist.github.com/yaroslavvb/1124bb02a9fd4abce3d86caf2f950cb2) adds 100MB vectors of 1's in one process to variable in another process on local machine. If I look at timeline/stepstats, I see 120ms of emptiness, followed by 20ms in `AddOp` followed by another 700ms of missing time.

Because it's a toy benchmark, I can figure out that 120ms is spent in transferring 100MB from one TF runtime to another, and 700ms is spent making the result available to Python client. But it's harder to do this on a large model

4808,.ckpt file cann't be freezed into .pb after run eval_image_classifier.py,"This is a very strange issue i meet. i do not know what changes are made by eval_image_classifier.py
### Environment info

Ubuntu 16.04
### Steps:
1. Train inception v1 (slim) model and get .ckpt files.
2. Run freeze_graph to freeze .ckpt file into .pb file, like cmd below:

**bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph \
 --input_graph=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/graph.pbtxt \
 --input_checkpoint=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/model.ckpt-73074 \
 --output_graph=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/freeze.pb \
 --output_node_names=InceptionV1/Logits/Predictions/Softmax**

you will get:

**Converted 173 variables to const ops.
1766 ops in the final graph.**

 3, Run model evaluation by cmd below

**python eval_image_classifier.py \
  --checkpoint_path=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/model.ckpt-73074 \
  --eval_dir=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/ \
  --dataset_name=animals \
  --dataset_split_name=validation \
  --dataset_dir=/home/data/datadic_train/ \
  --model_name=inception_v1 \
  --batch_size=256 \
  --labels_offset=0**

then you will get the result like: 
**I tensorflow/core/kernels/logging_ops.cc:79] eval/Accuracy[0.7301592]**

 4, Now run the cmd in step 2 again to freeze the same .ckpt file

CMD:

**bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph \
 --input_graph=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/graph.pbtxt \
 --input_checkpoint=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/model.ckpt-73074 \
 --output_graph=/home/tensorflow/v1.3sgd_copy/freeze.pb \
 --output_node_names=InceptionV1/Logits/Predictions/Softmax**

Then you will get errors: **Attempting to use uninitialized value accuracy/total**

4807,Upgrade to libjpeg-turbo,"TensorFlow seems to be using the classic libjpeg v 0.9, but libjpeg-turbo is heavily optimized to leverage SIMD on various platforms (x86, ARM, POWER, etc.), and is both API and ABI compatible with libjpeg, at least up to libjpeg 0.8. Given TensorFlow's goal of portability across a wide varierty of platforms, I'm wondering if libjpeg was decided upon instead of libjpeg-turbo for portability, or was this just an omission? 

libjpeg-turbo speeds up JPEG decoding by about 2x, and since that reduces decoding latency and increases throughput, it not only improves performance of TensorFlow on the CPU, but especially on the GPU, which tends to wait for the CPU to provide decoded images. Moreover, that could result in a major performance improvement on more CPU-underpowered platforms such as ARM (e.g. via NEON SIMD on the NVIDIA TX1 platform which uses the NEON-capable Cortex A57, or on ARM Cortex A8 on a Samsung Galaxy S).

4797,Error following the wide and deep tutorial ,"I've been trying to follow through the wide and deep tutorial on a different data set and I am getting the below error.

I am using this version of tensorflow: tensorflow-0.11.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
on python: Python 2.7.5

All my fields are strings (features and labels)

I am adding the relevant code snippets

```
f1Col = tf.contrib.layers.sparse_column_with_keys(""f1"", keys = [""l1"", ""l2"", ""l3""])
..
..
I've defined all columns similar to this one (no hash bucket ones)
..
..

```

```
wide_columns = [
  tf.contrib.layers.crossed_column(columns = [f1Col, f2Col, f3Col] , hash_bucket_size = 1e7),
  ...
  defined all crossed columns like the above one with smaller hash buckets for ones with less features
  ...
]
```

```
deep_columns = [
    tf.contrib.layers.embedding_column(f1Col, dimension=8),
    ...
   defined all my features here as embedding columns exactly as the one above
   ....
]
```

tried this with both settings for enable_centered_bias the error changes a bit but is still the same

```
import tempfile
model_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
m = tf.contrib.learn.DNNLinearCombinedClassifier(
    model_dir=model_dir,
    linear_feature_columns=wide_columns,
    dnn_feature_columns=deep_columns,
    dnn_hidden_units=[1000, 500, 250], enable_centered_bias = False)
```

```
def input_fn(df):
  categorical_cols = {k: tf.SparseTensor(
      indices=[[i, 0] for i in range(df[k].size)],
      values=df[k].values,
      shape=[df[k].size, 1])
                      for k in my_features_col_list}
  label = tf.constant(df['my_label_col'].values)
  return categorical_cols, label

def train_input_fn():
  return input_fn(features)

def eval_input_fn():
  return input_fn(features)
```

then when I try to fit like this:
`m.fit(input_fn=train_input_fn, steps=200)`

I get the following error. I am not sure if I hit a bug or did something wrong. I am getting some warnings in the earlier code about combiner function defaults changing

Then again when executing the fit I get the 2 warnings and then the error below them:

```
WARNING:tensorflow:Given features: {'f1': <tensorflow.python.framework.ops.SparseTensor object at 0xc5bf690>, ... required signatures: {'f1': TensorSignature(dtype=tf.string, shape=None, is_sparse=True), ...

4795,Make //tensorflow/cc:cc_ops compile for Android,"It seems that the bazel target //tensorflow/cc:cc_ops is currently not compilable for Android. From what I saw, this is at least because of the missing platform specific headers (e.g. in tensorflow/core/platform/gif.h).

Making the cc_ops compilable for Android would allow to fully use tensorflow on Android. In particular, I'm trying to build tensorflow for Android with the operations to be able to provide [javacpp-presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) which allow an automated generation of complete Java bindings. Therefore they can be used to completely omit the jni/C++ code in Android applications that want to use tensorflow.

4781,`tf.scan` has Unexpected Behavior on Python CLI/Shell,"### Version Info

'0.10.0rc0'
OS: Ubuntu
### Issue

While this doesn't affect runtime behavior, using the high level function `tf.scan` in the python shell results in unexpected behavior. Running the op whilst functional yields expected results. Running again with bad parameters (wrong dtype) raises exception, which is also expected. Running the original op again raises the same exception, which is not expected.
### To Reproduce

Via python CLI, run a working `tf.scan` function, run one that doesn't work, then run the original.

```
>>> import tensorflow as tf

>>> tf.Session().run(tf.scan(lambda a, x: [a[0] + 1, tf.to_int64(0)], tf.constant([1,2,3,4,5],dtype=tf.int64), initializer=[tf.to_int64(-1), tf.to_int64(0)]))

[array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])]

4775,"Compile tensorflow with compile option ""-xMIC-AVX512"" does not work","Hi, All

I want to use AVX512 with tensorflow because vectorization can increase performance.
In addition, building any program with icpc(Intel compiler) and compile option ""-xMIC-AVX512"" can vectorize automatically in state-of-art Intel machine.
So, I use the command as below:

`CC=icpc bazel build -c opt --copt=-xMIC-AVX512 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package`

But when I type the command, build does not work.
### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
- Nothing exist related my issue in GitHub or StackOverflow
### Environment info
- Operating System: Centos 7.2.1511 
- Tensorflow version: r0.10.0 source code version
- Only use CPU
### What other attempted solutions have you tried?

As far as I know, linear algebra library for Tensorflow is ""Eigen library"" and SIMD vectorizations(like SSE, AVX, etc.) are applied to the Eigen library.
So, I changed Eigen source code to apply the AVX512 and gcc compile option ""-mavx512f"" referring two links([eigen bug report](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=1306), [Benoit Steiner's Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/benoitsteiner/eigen-avx512)), but I didn't apply AVX512 because there was little information about that.

If someone know the method about applying AVX512 or the date to release Eigen version with AVX512,  please tell me about that.

Thank you very much.
"
4774,weights_initializer in tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected,"Hi, 

At present contrib.layers.fully_connected is unable to accept a Tensor as an initializer for the weights.

This because when calling variable_scope.get_variable (which accepts a Tensor as an initializer) it specifies both the initializer and the shape. Is this expected behavior or a bug? 

I have put together a small [gist ](https://gist.github.com/marcoadurno/60faf136193d8eccc83d14932d188d25) that illustrates the issue.

At present what's the recommended way to pass a Tensor as an initializer? Would a [dummy init_fn](https://gist.github.com/marcoadurno/60faf136193d8eccc83d14932d188d25#file-layers_weights_test-py-L34) be acceptable?

I'm currently running rev: 9c11fe2f1db1ccf5bcdb0724c18cc462ff5fbbd7.

Thanks,

4763,Ability to Save Checkpoints Every N Steps using Estimator,"TensorFlow Version: r0.10.0rc0

For TensorFlow/SKFlow/tf,learn Estimators, there is no option for specifying when an Estimator saves checkpoints other than `save_checkpoints_secs` in a `RunConfig`, which isn't usable for a monitor such as `ValidationMonitor`. For example, if I want to do early stopping and check every 10 steps, it is definitely not guaranteed that new checkpoints were saved for the model, even if I specify `save_checkpoints_secs` to be 1 second.
### Tried:

It is currently not possible to use a `CheckpointMonitor` with an `Estimator` (e.g. `LinearClassifier`) as far as I can tell. There is no saver nor Scaffold I can specify that captures the same variables it does normally.

When can we expect this capability, and are there workarounds currently?
"
4762,Request for documentation: Loop implementation,"I am trying to understand the implementation of `tf.while_loop` and everything that is built on top of it, because I am implementing a custom `tf.Graph` subclass, and finding that the way `tf.while_loop` is handled during gradient computation is important for what I am doing. 

However, I cannot find any documentation on the ops that comprise `tf.while_loop` – is there any internal documentation on this implementation?

I am finding myself confused about some of the following concepts:
- `WhileContext`, and, in general, the stack of contexts
- Flows vs tensors
- Frames

So far I've gotten quite a bit by just reading the source code, but it's pretty hard to build yourself a good mental model by going completely bottom up without having any high level picture of how the entire thing is organized.

If there is no intention to document these things (which would be completely understandable) please feel free to close this issue (although I would definitely appreciate some help or pointers as to where I can figure out the high-level overview of looping implementation).

4757,import meta graph bug reading model with scope name changed,"Same issue for tf 0.10 and 0.11.rc0.
The problem is if you read one model, change the top scope name, write a new model, then you read the new model, but still you got the old top scope name.
How to reproduce 
- create model
  python create-model.py
  
  ```
  import tensorflow as tf  
  
  sess = tf.InteractiveSession()  
  
  with tf.variable_scope('old'):  
  
      w = tf.get_variable('w', shape=[1], initializer=tf.constant_initializer(1.0))  
  
  sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())  
  
  tf.train.Saver().save(sess, '/tmp/old.model')  
  ```
- read this model (using import meta graph), then rename top scope and save to one new model
  python rename-scope.py
  old_vars: [u'old/w:0']
  new_vars: [u'new/w']  
  
  ```
  import tensorflow as tf  
  
  sess = tf.InteractiveSession()  
  
  saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('/tmp/old.model.meta')  
  
  saver.restore(sess, '/tmp/old.model')  
  
  src_vars = [v for v in tf.all_variables() if v.name.startswith('old')]  
  
  print('old_vars:', [v.name for v in src_vars])
  
  out_vars = {v.name[:v.name.rfind(':')].replace('old', 'new', 1): v for v in src_vars}  
  
  print('new_vars:', [key for key in out_vars])  
  
  tf.train.Saver(var_list=out_vars).save(sess, '/tmp/new.model') 
  ```
- read new model(It is ok if you buid graph from scratch with new scope, but not ok if using import meta graph again)
  # -------------------this is ok
  
  python read-renamed-buildgraph.py  
  tf.all_variables: [u'new/w:0']
  w val: [ 1.]
  
  ```
  import tensorflow as tf  
  
  sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
  
  with tf.variable_scope('new'):
      w = tf.get_variable('w', shape=[1], initializer=tf.constant_initializer(2.0))  
  
  tf.train.Saver().restore(sess, '/tmp/new.model')  
  
  print('tf.all_variables:', [v.name for v in tf.all_variables()])  
  
  print('w val:',  w.eval())
  ```
  # ---------------this is wrong
  
  python read-renamed-metagraph.py

My program will face this some times(not every run will face this..), then if face this I can always reproduce this error loading from the last model I have saved before program crash due to nan. When rerun from this model, first train process seems fine using the model to generate loss(I have printed loss and shows no problem), but after applying gradients, the values of embedding variables will turn to Nan. So Nan in embedding will casue histogram collecting info crash.  If not use histogram, program will not crash(assertion fail) but since Nan exists the model is corrupted.

So what is the root cause of the nan problem? Confused as not know how to debug further and this program with same data and params will mostly run ok and only face this problem during some run..

      otherwise it must have the same structure as `elems`.
```

.

But actually the first argument of _fn_ should have the same structure as _initializer_, 

and the second should have the same structure as _elems_.

As we can see this in few examples just below, from line 448,

``````
  Examples:
    ```python
    elems = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    sum = scan(lambda a, x: a + x, elems)
    # sum == [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]
    ```
    ```python
    elems = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    initializer = np.array(0)
    sum_one = scan(
        lambda a, x: x[0] - x[1] + a, (elems + 1, elems), initializer)
    # sum_one == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```
    ```python
    elems = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    initializer = (np.array(0), np.array(1))
    fibonaccis = scan(lambda a, _: (a[1], a[0] + a[1]), elems, initializer)
    # fibonaccis == ([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13])
    ```
``````

, the instruction is slightly wrong.

4748,Configure fail when install from source code,"I Installed with following settings: centOS 7, CUDA 7.5, cudnn v4, python 2.7

Anybody encountered the same problem? How can I fix this issue?

4746,ksize in max_pool,"I am trying to build a convolution (followed by max_pool) for variable length input size. Since the length of the input in a batch should be the same, I set the batch size to 1. However, for some reason ksize in tf.nn.max_pool is a list attribute required at run-time. This would prevent any neural network that uses variable input size to apply max pool. Is there a workaround for this? Should ksize be an input tensor otherwise?
"
4744,Poor performance with multi-GPU,"I tried to train the example inception-v3 network on multiple GPUs. The following commands are used:
/\* use 4 GPUs */
bazel-bin/inception/imagenet_train --num_gpus=4 --batch_size=64 --max_steps=2000 --train_dir=... --data_dir=...

/*use 2 GPUs */
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
bazel-bin/inception/imagenet_train --num_gpus=2 --batch_size=32 --max_steps=2000 --train_dir=... --data_dir=...

/*use 1 GPU */
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
bazel-bin/inception/imagenet_train --num_gpus=1 --batch_size=16 --max_steps=2000 --train_dir=... --data_dir=...

The performance results are as follows:
GPUs   Training time(s)       samples/sec
1           657                          52.7
2           844                          97.3
4           1104                        150

The training time was got from the log file by subtracting the first time from the last time and therefore excluded the start-up time. For example
2016-10-03 15:28:23.239148: step 0, loss = 13.08 (4.6 examples/sec; 13.916 sec/batch)
....
2016-10-03 15:46:47.830959: step 1990, loss = 12.21 (174.6 examples/sec; 0.367 sec/batch)

Now the part that I do not understand is that the samples/sec scales normally with increasing number of GPUs, but the training time does not reduce. Instead the training also increases with more GPUs. 

Has anyone observed the similar case? 
### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?

I tried to set --input_queue_memory_factor=0 as in the post https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/47, but it does not help.

Also the post https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4272 has similar performance issue, but it was not solved.

By the way, before the actual computation, the overhead of the initialization took >7minutes, is that normal? And I also got many warnings:
WARNING:tensorflow:tf.op_scope(values, name, default_name) is deprecated, use tf.name_scope(name, default_name, values)
WARNING:tensorflow:tf.variable_op_scope(values, name, default_name) is deprecated, use tf.variable_scope(name, default_name, values)
WARNING:tensorflow:Passing a `GraphDef` to the SummaryWriter is deprecated. Pass a `Graph` object instead, such as `sess.graph`.

Will all these warnings impact the performance?

4742,Atrous convolution does not preserve tensor shape,"For an input with an undefined batch size, `atrous_conv2d` emits tensors where all except the final dimension are undefined:

``` python
input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None, 256, 256, 3))

conv = tf.nn.conv2d(input, tf.zeros((3, 3, 3, 16)), strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
print(conv.get_shape()) # Correctly displays (?, 256, 256, 16)

dilated = tf.nn.atrous_conv2d(input, tf.zeros((3, 3, 3, 16)), rate=2, padding='SAME')
print(dilated.get_shape()) # Displays (?, ?, ?, 16)
```

(For concrete batch sizes, everything works as expected.)

4740,fully_connected_preloaded_var.py unexpectedly slow,"From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39840323/benchmark-of-howto-reading-data -- `examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py` runs roughly 10x faster per step (`feed_dict`) than `examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_preloaded_var.py` (TF variable with `slice_input_producer`). Looking at Timeline (attached), it seems the training is bottlenecked on QueueDequeueMany which takes 13ms
which is about 100x slower than corresponding segment on `feed_dict` example [timeline](%28https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/507483/timeline.feed.json.zip%29). Also, the timing taken by `QueueDequeueMany` scales linearly with batch-size. IE, increasing batch-size to 200 makes it take 22ms.

4738,Feature Request: Include function argument defaults in the documentation,"I have recently started using functions from tf.contrib. They speed things up a lot. Thank you. 

I did notice that some of the prototypes in the documents have their arguments replaced with `(*args, **kwargs)`. See tf.contrib.layers: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/contrib.layers.html#layers-contrib. Perhaps this is automatically done if the number of arguments exceeds some number. Unfortunately the prototype is the only place where the argument defaults are shown. I have been looking at the source file, layers.py, to see the full prototype for the defaults which is fine, but probably not idea. 

My request is to include the argument defaults somewhere in the documentation. I wouldn't mind long prototypes, i.e. getting rid of the `(*args, **kwargs)`. Or if people want the shorter prototypes, maybe the argument defaults could be automatically included somewhere in the description.

4737,No gradient defined for operation EluGrad,"tf.nn.elu does not support second derivatives currently. 

This would be awesome, as in variational autoencoder models these activation functions improve performance by a few nats in the objective compared to tanh, sigmoid (which do support second derivatives).

In the meantime I'm using `elu = lambda x: tf.select(x < 0., tf.exp(x) - 1., x)` which seems to work:

```
In [29]: elu = lambda x: tf.select(x < 0., tf.exp(x) - 1., x)

4733,Bidirectional RNN: forward and backward passing to the middle of the sentence,"Hi all, I have a task that requires me to split a sentence into two and model the two parts respectively using bidirectional rnn, e.g.:

**""I think of A, but I am going to B tomorrow""** split into **""I think of A""** and **""but I am going to B tomorrow""**; forward passing goes from ""I"" to ""A"" while backward passing goes from ""tomorrow"" to ""but"". This way two outputs are trained using directional rnn and then concatenated before feeding to the softmax layer.

My question is, is there an easier to achieve this using bidirectional_rnn in Tensorflow that I am not aware of? Or I have to split the sentence first, reverse the order of the 2nd part, and then model the two parts using two rnn networks respectively (which is what I am doing now). 

Thanks!!

### Environment info

Tried both OS X and Linux (Ubuntu 16)
On both utilizing CPU only.
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Any simple operation (i.e. calculating logits with a 3 layer deep network with simple regression in each layer) in which the data was fed with either a `parse_example`, `parse_single_example`, building a `CustomRunner` that feeds a `RandomShuffleQueue` or utilizing `QueueRunner`.  In all of those the operation and time to complete 1 epoch took considerably more than if I were to save the data in a bumpy array and feed it during a call to `sess.run()` with the `feed_dict`.
### What other attempted solutions have you tried?

Tried to score the web for solutions and ran into a couple blog posts describing the problem but can't seem to find solutions.
### Logs or other output that would be helpful

Tried this on both TF 0.10 and the latest RC for 0.11.

No

If installed from binary pip package, provide:
1. A link to the pip package you installed:
   I install tensorflow from source following this site: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/makefile
2. The output from `python -c ""import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)""`.
   But It seems i cant get the tensorflow version command, there is no module named tensorflow; I also installed tensorflow with docker on my Mac.

If installed from source, provide 
1. The commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`)

I followed the ios_example from here, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples
I successfully installed the static library containing the core code of tensorflow;
I downloaded the incetption v1, and I have xcode 7.3.1 installed on my Mac;
When I launch xcode from tf_ios_makefile_example.xcodeproj in the subfolder tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples/simple, I got un error:
# include ""unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor""

What did I miss? the version of eigen is not right? I do install eigen.

Any suggestion will be appreciated
Thanks

4727,Minor issues with C++ custom ops documentation,"I was following the instructions below to define a custom op called `zero_out`.

I found a few issues:
1. You cannot load a `so` file without giving an absolute path (or prefixing with `./`). 
2. The zero_out_module has no zero_out component.

4722,einsum not fully implemented,"I am glad to see the newly added einsum function. The documentation claims that its usage is the same as numpy. However, it can do almost nothing as compared to numpy. For example, it only supports subscripts in the form of '_->_'. Unfortunately, even matrix transpose does not work, i.e., 'ij->ji'. 
Numpy works:

```
>>> A
array([[ 0.3828997 , -0.39114848, -0.09727838, -0.20430113],

       [-0.30885863,  0.21669025,  0.31648793,  0.22417514],
       [ 0.32505724,  0.30478035,  0.48655034,  0.20040547]])
>>> einsum('ij->ji',A)

       [-0.20430113,  0.25665744,  0.22417514,  0.20040547]])
```

Tensorflow does not work:

```
pseudo-code:
M_ = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([4,4]))
N_ = tf.einsum('ij->ji',M_)

```

I want to multiply a matrix with every frame vector in every batch. Or similar operations which can be done by a simple tensor product. It seems that I still have to duplicate the matrix so many times and perform a batch_matmul, which is very inconvenient and slow and memory consuming.

I suggest tensorflow to implement either the tensordot or einsum function which can perform tensor product.

It is quite a shame that tensorflow cannot even perform basic tensor product so far :(

So it works. But I would like to be able to somehow review the progress, other than my current F5-stategy.
I recon all image summaries are saved inside, but I cannot obtain them through Tensorboard.

print shape(trainY) # (802, 1)
classifier.fit(x=trainX, y=trainY, steps=2000)

This worked fine on 0.10.0. Notice the shapes in the beginning of output (looks like a valid combination to me).

4714,TensorBoard Feature Request: [DASHBOARD] Static Variable Display Tab,"I do a lot of different runs which contain descriptions as well as different meta parameters.  It would be nice to have a tab on TensorBoard so I can tell which experiment I am viewing.

My thought would be to simply add static variables from the Graph which might include Strings, Ints, Floats, (maybe matrix in table format if possible, like PCA parameters, maybe confusion matrix, etc).  These may include a text description, current learning rate, network meta parameters, etc.  It would be good to simple present the ""current"" value of these variables so if there is a search on Discount Rates for RL or variation such as learning rate, those can be viewed.  This would be different from simply graphing the Learning rate as that shows the history rather than ""current"".  I think of this as a TensorFlow ""Dashboard"" that I can setup.

Something like:
tf.dashboard_summary(tags, tensor/value, collections=None, name=None)

eg:
tf.dashboard_summary(""Description:"",description_string_tensor_or_python_string)
tf.dashboard_summary(""Learning Rate:"",lr_tensor)
tf.dashboard_summary(""DiscountRate:"",discountRate_python_variable)

In this case, a ""DASHBOARD"" tab on tensorflow would contain the 3 labels above and the tensor/value.  If the value is a python variable, then it should be considered constant and will not change over the graph lifecycle.  If it is a tensor/variable, then it should be pulled from the graph at each iteration.

I can help but not sure where to jump in to get this started.

4705,Error building with cuda after bazel server dies,"This is effectively reopening #4105 as this is another way to reproduce the issue that I am seeing repeatedly. The fix for #4105 was to make sure after running configure clean+fetch is run.

I see this issue almost every day so I'm not sure if bazel flushes some caches or the daemon is dying, but the issue reliably reproduces by killing the bazel daemon. Having to re-run configure and restart the build from scratch is unreasonable, since there is a workaround that avoids a rebuild so this looks very much like a bug.

In short, the workaround whenever the bazel server dies is, assuming you've backed up your crosstool directory in /tmp/crosstool/:

```
bazel fetch //tensorflow/...
cp -aR /tmp/crosstool/* $bazel_build_dir/external/local_config_cuda/crosstool/
```

This looks like a bug to me and the resolution of #4105 just doesn't seem related to this, it just coincidentally fixes it.

```

        # c = tf.greater(grad, 1)
        c = tf.is_finite(var)
        with tf.control_dependencies([c]):
            newGrad = tf.select(c, tf.Print(grad, [grad, var, tf.is_nan(grad), c]), grad)
            with tf.control_dependencies([newGrad]):
                new_gvs.append((newGrad, var))
    gvs = new_gvs
```
## 2 with is_nan 'var'

```
gvs = [(tf.select(tf.is_nan(var), tf.Print(grad, [grad, var, tf.is_nan(grad), tf.is_nan(var)]), grad), var) for grad, var in gvs]
```

4677,strided_slice unexpected behaviour,"On commit `931ff427f3a55a9c6c734a4c325d6af1b53665c3`, the following happens when trying to slice a tensor with an invalid slice.

# Also when calling the function directly:
tf.strided_slice(t, [4, 0], [5, 1], [1, 1], shrink_axis_mask=0b11).eval()

4675,LinearClassifier feature_columns overwritten in LinearClassifier.fit,"`tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.linear.LinearClassifier.fit`
effectively returns
`tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.estimator.Estimator.fit`
`Estimator.fit` calls:
`tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.estimator.Estimator._train_model`
which has these lines:

```
      features, targets = input_fn()
      self._check_inputs(features, targets)
      train_op, loss_op = self._get_train_ops(features, targets)
```

`tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators.estimator.Estimator._check_inputs`

```
    if self._features_info is not None:
      ...
    else:
      self._features_info = tensor_signature.create_signatures(features)
```

So we get to a point where features, as derived from the input_fn, is treated as our feature columns set.

In pseudo code:

```
def input_function()
    return [foo, bar, baz], quux

lc=LinearClassifier(feature_columns=[foo]) # We pass in what we want our feature column to be
lc.fit(input_function) # run fit on out input function
lc._feature_columns # repr _feature_columns on the instantiated classifier
    [foo]
lc.estimator._features_info # _features_info on the instantiated classifiers instantiated estimator
    [foo, bar, baz]
```
### The issue is:

Although this line appears to indicate that we will be making an estimation based on the feature columns supplied:
`lc=LinearClassifier(feature_columns=[foo]) # We pass in what we want our feature column to be`
What happens is that the passed in `feature_columns` is unused and instead the return from the input_function supplied to fit are used.

Am I correct in thinking that if the `feature_columns` arg is supplied that only those columns should be used by the classifiers estimator?
That when we instantiate the classifier we are setting the feature_columns we expect to be used?

The work around for this is simply to only return the columns you need from your input function however I found this misleading.

Point in the tutorial:
Either the code or the tutorial need to be changed.

4661,Defun grad_func should accept the outputs of the function being differentiated,"When dealing with discrete stochastic units, one often wants to define custom gradients. It seems like the most legitimate way to it in Tensorflow is to use `grad_func` keyword argument of `function.Defun` from `tensorflow.python.framework`.  However, the gradient function is only given the inputs of the function defined and the gradients, whereas it would be often very convenient to also use the outputs. 

For example, see the code below.

``` python
# In current Tensorflow I have to do like this:

@function.Defun(*(3 * [tf.float32]))
def oneovertwo_unit_bprop(probs, noise, grads):
  outcome = tf.to_float(tf.less(noise, probs))
  outcome_probs = outcome * probs + (1 - outcome) * (1 - probs)
  return grads / 2. / outcome_probs, tf.zeros_like(noise)


@function.Defun(*(2 * [tf.float32]), grad_func=oneovertwo_unit_bprop)
def oneovertwo_unit_fprop(probs, noise):
  return tf.to_float(tf.less(noise, probs))


def oneovertwo_unit(probs):
  return oneovertwo_unit_fprop(probs, tf.random_uniform(tf.shape(probs)))

# I would like to do like this

def oneovertwo_unit_bprop(probs, outcome, grads):
  outcome_probs = outcome * probs + (1 - outcome) * (1 - probs)
  return grads / 2. / outcome_probs


@function.Defun(*(2 * [tf.float32]), grad_func=oneovertwo_unit_bprop)
def oneovertwo_unit(probs):
  return tf.to_float(tf.less(tf.random_uniform(probs.get_shape()), probs))

- If finally I restrict to CPU only, it works fine.

I verified, both host and docker have the same driver version (367.48 ), cuda is installed correctly (on my host AND in my docker), nvdia-smi correctly finds the 2 GPUs, deviceQuery runs fine (also on the host and inside the docker), cudnn libraries are there, and moreover caffe works just fine on the gpus, which would indicate that my install is indeed correct.

The problem persists with cudnn 5.1, and on both version of cudnn if i rollback to tensorflow 0.9
### Environment info

But the problem remains with cudnn 5.1

If installed from binary pip package, provide:
1. A link to the pip package you installed:
   `http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.10.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl`

(but the problem reproduces with tensorflow 0.9)
1. The output from `python -c ""import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)""`.

### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Complicated at this point, but I'm not sure its relevant...
### What other attempted solutions have you tried?

Tried with cudnn-5 and cudnn 5.1, and tensorflow 0.9 / 0.10

4652,tensorflow running principle ,"1. In tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq_model.py  line 236 , we see the output_feed cosists of  self.updates and self.gradient_norms.
   And the self.updates is not used in anywhere, I wonder if I can delete this from output_feed ?
2. How does the tensorflow run:  If a variable is not in its output_feed list, does tensorflow count this variable ?

4651,Distributed tensorflow hangs ,"I set up a distributed tensorflow according to the inception example(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception/inception), with a very deep network.
During training(minutes or hours), it must run into hanging. No error occurs in ps or workers, but the cpu/gpu usage falls to zero and no any further steps are made.
If I replace the network with a much simpler one(much less variables), all things work fine.
Is there any limit on the amount of vars placed on ps? or any suggestions to deal with the problem?

4648,tf.contrib.learn.estimator each call to predict() reloads the model,"### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?

None
### Environment info

Operating System:
OSX & Ubuntu 14.04
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example - Explanation

Each call to estimator.predict() completely reloads the model, which is very slow. Is there any mechanism to maintain the model in GPU/memory for consecutive calls? 

I understand that large arrays can be passed to the function for simultaneous predictions, but my use case is for slowly arriving data which must be processed quickly. Is there a mechanism for decreasing the 'start-up' time of this function?

4643,Inf/Nan in MSE/CE with very simple demo,"Hi there,

I would use a very simple LSTM demo with only forward without any BP tuning to clear the question. I pass one random batch of size (2,2,3) to a rnn_cell.LSTMcell, using 100 hidden layer, and output the mse/ce between the output and the last time step (:, -1, :). What strike me is the both the SE/CE are very strange (too large or even inf).

Below is my code.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


n_steps = 2
n_visible = 3
n_hidden = 100

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float64, [None, n_steps, n_visible])
x_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float64, [None, n_steps, n_visible])
batch_size = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)

low = - 4 * np.sqrt(6. / (n_hidden + n_visible))
high = 4 * np.sqrt(6. / (n_hidden + n_visible))


W2 = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_hidden ,n_visible], minval=low, maxval=high, dtype=tf.float64))

b2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(n_visible, dtype = tf.float64))


lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(n_hidden, state_is_tuple = True, forget_bias=1.)
initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float64)
state = initial_state

inputs = [tf.squeeze(input_, [1])  for input_ in tf.split(1, n_steps, x)]
encoder = tf.nn.rnn(lstm_cell, inputs, initial_state=initial_state)
decoder = tf.nn.sigmoid(tf.matmul(encoder[-1][0], W2) + b2)

ce = -x[:,-1,:] * tf.log(decoder)+(1-x[:,-1,:])*tf.log(1 - decoder)
se = (x[:,-1,:] - decoder)**2
mse = tf.reduce_mean(se)
rmse = tf.sqrt(mse)


sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
x_train_batch = np.random.rand(2,2,3)
feed_dict = {x: x_train_batch, x_:x_train_batch, batch_size: 2}
encoder_, decoder_, se_, mse_, rmse_, ce_=  sess.run([encoder, decoder, se, mse, rmse, ce], feed_dict=feed_dict)

```

The outputs are:

```
ce_
Out[2]: 
array([[ -9.30480083e-001,  -7.45718134e-001,   1.65488117e+243],

Out[3]: 
array([[  3.66794556e-001,   2.76262193e-001,               inf],
       [  3.48428030e-001,   2.86745693e-001,   1.23185516e+129]])

Out[4]: 
array([[ 0.60563566,  0.5256065 ,  0.62439037],

       [ 0.57656244,  0.73494513,  0.57125778]])

```

The value of decoder and x seems well, but why ce_ and se_ has inf and some weird value like 1.23E+129?

It is running on a Mac OS EI Captain 64 bit without GPU support.

4617,sparse lookup tables for tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse,"Hope that “**params**” of **tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse** support **SparseTensor**!!!

[tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse(params, sp_ids, sp_weights, partition_strategy='mod', name=None, combiner='mean')](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/nn.html#embedding_lookup_sparse)

The efficiency of sparse lookup tables is low,  but it is very useful for large-scale linear regression system, especially when designing a prototype. 
For example, the wide part of ""wide and deep learning"" use sparse features.
Although I don't know when the hashing function is applied, using sparse lookup table is more accurate than hashing.  The hashing function may merge two features into one bin (share the same weight), or discard new features when the lookup table is full.

After installing tensorflow from source on an EC2 machine and attempting to import keras, I recieved an `AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python' has no attribute 'control_flow_ops'` error. The same error mentioned in: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3857. I noticed that after this tensorflow commit: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5563229b5b45917cd8155bc47a8356af90fb20a2#diff-6ad579dc34adb7a581b8c0bcb1a4dd79

that `tensorflow.python.control_flow_ops` was no longer accessible and thus is what is breaking the code. I got around it by doing `from tensorflow.python.ops import control_flow_ops`.

Should I submit a pull request to keras or does tensorflow have a plan to fix this issue?

4614,It might be better to have one more return value in function `tf.unique()` showing the indexes in the original array,"The function `tf.unique(x, name=None)` finds the unique elements in a 1-D tensor. And it now returns two value: `y` and `idx`. `y` contains all of the unique elements of `x` sorted inthe same order that they occur in `x`. `idx` contains the index of each value of `x` in the unique output `y`.

```
# tensor 'x' is [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 8, 8]
y, idx = tf.unique(x)
y ==> [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
idx ==> [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

BUT i think a third return value which contains the first index of each value of `y` in the original tensor `x` is also needed. It might work like this:

```
# tensor 'x' is [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 8, 8]
y, idx, idx_ori  = tf.unique(x)
y ==> [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
idx ==> [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
idx_ori ==> [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
```

Just like its equivalent in Numpy does:

```
array 'x' is [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 8, 8]
y, idx_ori = np.unique(x, return_index=True)
y ==> [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]
idx_ori ==> [0, 2, 3, 6, 7]
```
"
4613,Maybe there should be an argument 'unique' in the function `tf.where()`,"There IS the case where we wanna find the first position of the `True` element in a tensor.
suppose there is a tensor `a` like this:

```
[array([[[ True, False],
        [False, False]],

       [[False,  True],
        [ True, False]],

       [[False, False],
        [False,  True]],

       [[False, False],
        [ True, False]]], dtype=bool)
```

and u run `tf.where(a)`, u will get:

```
 array([[0, 0, 0],
       [1, 0, 1],
       [1, 1, 0],
       [2, 1, 1],
       [3, 1, 0]])]
```

But we sometimes want a result like this:

```
 array([[0, 0, 0],
       [1, 0, 1],
       [2, 1, 1],
       [3, 1, 0]])]

```

which show us the index of first `True` element instead of all `True` elements.

I suppose the function `tf.where()` might as well add an argument `unique` , indicating whether u wanna show all true element positions or the first one. And the default value of `unique` should be False. 
the prototype might be like this:

```
tf.where(input, unique=False, name=None)
```

and for the requirements shown above, i might run something like this:

```
tf.where(a, unique = True)
```

### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Using commands from https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/index.html to create a model:

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
x_data = np.random.rand(100).astype(np.float32)
y_data = x_data * 0.1 + 0.3
W = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([1], -1.0, 1.0))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = W * x_data + b
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_data))

train = optimizer.minimize(loss)
init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)
sess.run(train)

Then this works:

```
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.save(sess, 'my-model')
sess = tf.Session()
new_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-model.meta')
```

But this doesn't:

```
tf.train.export_meta_graph(filename='my-model.meta')
new_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-model.meta')
```

"
4600,fold/scan gradient high memory usage,"It seems that the gradients for higher order functions (foldl/foldr/scan) require a very large amount of memory.

The following code block will easily compute `res` (even with `swap_memory` disabled) but will fail when computing `grad`:

``` python
v = tf.Variable([1.0])
def foo(aggregate, arr):
    arr = v * tf.tile(arr, [10000])
    return aggregate + arr[0, 0]

arr = np.empty([10000, 1000], dtype=np.float32)
res = tf.foldl(foo, arr, 0.0, 1, swap_memory=True)
opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.001)
grad = opt.compute_gradients(res)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
sess.run(res) #This will run
sess.run(grad) #This will cause an OOM error
```

This was tested on a machine with a GTX1070 and 24GB RAM. 

I'm guessing that what's happening is that tensorflow is only keeping track of data necessary for one iteration of `foldl` at a time when computing `res` (~40MB) but has to keep track of all the memory in all iterations of `foldl` when computing `grad` (~400GB).

In fact, reducing `arr` to be of size 1000x1000, still causes an OOM error, but reducing the size of `arr` to be 500x1000 ends up with the code block succeeding. This makes sense given that setting `arr` to these two sizes requires ~40GB and ~20GB respectively, the latter of which just fits on my machine's memory.

From what I understand of automatic differentiation, tensorflow shouldn't need to simultaneously keep track of the data needed across all iterations of `foldl` when computing gradients. Or am I missing something?

4595,Rename TF_Attr_Type and TF_Attr_Metadata,"The names of the `TF_Attr_Type` enum and `TF_Attr_Metadata` struct seem to be unlike any other names in the C API. Contrast them with `TF_OperationDescription`, `TF_SessionOptions`, `TF_SessionWithGraph`, and `TF_DataType`, which are also composed of multiple words. Since 0.11 hasn’t been released yet, perhaps it’s not too late to unify the naming scheme.

4590,Better shape inference for tf.slice and tf.strided_slice,"Currently, if any of the values in the `size` argument is not a constant, the output shape is completely unknown (but the correct rank):

``` python
>>> z = tf.zeros((1, 2, 3))
>>> z.get_shape().as_list()
[1, 2, 3]
>>> m = tf.slice(z, [0, 0, 0], [-1, -1, -1])
>>> m.get_shape().as_list()
[1, 2, 3]
>>> m = tf.slice(z, [0, 0, 0], [tf.constant(1) + 0, -1, -1])
>>> m.get_shape().as_list()
[None, None, None]
```

The desired behaviour would instead treat the second and third dimensions correctly:

``` python
>>> m = tf.slice(z, [0, 0, 0], [tf.constant(1) + 0, -1, -1])
>>> m.get_shape().as_list()
[None, 2, 3]
```

Looking briefly at the code, this would requite being a bit more clever in terms of how constant values are computed; right now if anything in a `Pack`-ed array is unknown at graph construction time, the entire array is unknown (see `_ConstantValue`'s `Pack` case).

I guess this request ends up being just a request for a better constant propagation system which supports partially-known tensors. Perhaps you already have other use cases for such a feature, in which case view this as just another request that such a feature would enable.

4589,Support for native half-float computation (float16/fp16),"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1300 added support for fp16 storage, but there is currently no support for native fp16 computation, which is available on some hardware such as Pascal GPUs.

In particular, the conv2d and matmul ops could take a new parameter along the lines of ""compute_dtype"", which would be plumbed through to CUDNN (convolution descriptor) and CUBLAS (Hgemm) in the backend, with the potential for up to a 2x speedup.

4581,How can user control the communication in distributed tensorflow,"sorry to trouble.
When I try to train model with ps and worker. I found that TensorFlow passed the whole gradients of each op between ps and each worker. 
If I explicitly calculate the gradient of inputs, which is defined as placeholder, TensorFlow passed these gradients. While the batch size of the inputs is too big, it makes the time of communication too long.
Is there any way to choose the parameters which user want to pass between ps and worker.

4567,tensorflow/contrib/makefile/download_dependencies.sh fails to parse workspace.bzl,"Hi, 

In download_dependencies.sh we grep tensorflow/workspace.bzl in order to determine which Eigen to download. We do this using the command `grep -o 'http.*bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/.*tar\.gz' tensorflow/workspace.bzl` which we then proceed to try and curl and untar (ln22).  

Due to the new format of workspace.bzl, that grep returns `http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/"" + eigen_version + "".tar.gz` which will download a 404 from bitbucket. Can we please update the makefile to account for this?

"
4552,Feature request: better handling of concurrent execution to prevent unnecessary out of memory failures ,"I have a model in which one operation happens to be very memory intensive and cannot be executed at once. I thought that by splitting the operation manually and executing parts of it individually (all on the GPU), I would get around the OOM problem. Unfortunately, it appears that TF aggressively tries to schedule as many ops to run in parallel as possible, even if that results in an OOM failure. I describe my specific issue further in this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39643250/best-way-to-split-computation-too-large-to-fit-into-memory).

It seems to me that this problem should be reasonably easy to solve, and is rather a serious current limitation of TF. The basic principle is that a computation should not fail if it's possible, in some sequential order, to execute it in memory. I'm not talking about situations in which TF has to be clever about splitting a seemingly atomic operations in parts. That I understand can be quite difficult and requires ""art"" on the part of the programmer. What I'm describing is a situation in which the computation graph, _as described_, can in fact be executed without running out of memory, but because TF is (overly) aggressive in scheduling independent ops concurrently, it runs out of memory.

The solution seems rather straight-forward. Before putting yet another op onto the GPU (or whatever hardware), TF should check if that would cause the memory to run out. If so, it should check if there's a cyclic dependency on the current op getting executed, i.e. it would be impossible for it to move forward unless the current op is executed. If so then that's a legitimate problem and it would fail with an OOM error. On the other hand, if it's possible for it to wait until other ops are executed before trying again, then it should simply wait until more memory is available. I.e. it should have a way to run independent operations sequentially.

I'm not familiar enough with the internals of TF to know how difficult a change like this would be, but as it currently stands, it seems like it's preventing a large swath of models from getting executed that otherwise could get executed.

On a related note, the dynamic_rnn op already seems to do this, where it's able to shuffle memory back and forth until the computation is done, and so perhaps there's an existing partial solution that I'm not aware of?

4550,Multilabel image classification with sparse labels?,"I want to perform a multilabel image classification task for n classes.
I've got sparse label vectors for each image and each dimension of each label vector is currently encoded in this way:
-   1.0 ->Label true / Image belongs to this class
- -1.0 ->Label false / Image does not contain to this class.
-  0.0 ->missing value/label

E.g.: V= {1.0,-1.0,1.0, 0.0}

For this example V the model should learn, that the corresponding image should be classified in the first and third class.

My problem is currently how to handle the missing values/labels. I've searched through the issues and found this issue:
[https://github.com/tensorflow/skflow/issues/113](https://github.com/tensorflow/skflow/issues/113)

So could do multilable image classification with:
[tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, targets, name=None)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/functions_and_classes/shard5/tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits.md)

but TensorFlow has this error function for sparse softmax, which is used for exclusive classification:
[tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, labels, name=None)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/functions_and_classes/shard4/tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits.md)

So is there something like sparse sigmoid cross entropy? (Couldn't find something) or any suggestions how can I handle my multilabel classification problem with sparse labels.

Would be a bit of a hassle, and I think I already found the bug so...

I've got a fairly simple model, it is fed by a `string_input_queue()` and then batched up by `shuffle_batch()` for training and `batch()` for evaluation. I'm using an `estimator.Estimator()` for the model and then calling `fit()` on the estimator with a `ValidationMonitor`.

I get a bunch of errors in the output when trying this. Here are the relevant parts:

Without the `ValidationMonitor`, everything is fine, but with it, most of these errors happen on every validate, and sometimes it throws the exception shown.

Of particular relevance is the error `Coordinator didn't stop cleanly: Attempted to use a closed Session.` which pretty clearly points out the problem.

You can see the exact situation the error is complaining about here:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/graph_actions.py#L757
There's even a comment saying that exactly that is about to be done, although I don't know why. If I move the `session.close()` after the `coord.join(...)` call, then all my problems go away.

Seems like a pretty clear problem with a pretty clear fix. Let me know if you need more details.

4542,"""Convolution"" across two matrices","Are there any plans to implement ""convolutions"" wherein we have a moving patch over a second matrix that acts as a changing filter?

This would be useful for implementing kernels such as this one:
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5348-convolutional-kernel-networks.pdf

I asked whether a restricted version of this could be achieved by using already existing tf ops on [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39632849/dot-product-of-patches-in-tensorflow). After thinking about it for a while though I don't think there's a way to do this in an efficient manner

For a simple convolution with no strides I could do something like:
`filters = tf.extract_image_patches(filter_matrix, [filter_height, filter_width], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], padding)`
`filters = tf.reshape(filters, [out_rows * out_cols, filter_height, filter_width, n_channels])`
`filters = tf.transpose(filters, [1, 2, 3, 0])`
`tf.conv2d(image, filters, [1, 1, 1, 1], padding)`
but it seems inefficient since I'd be generating an intermediate tensor that is going to be about filter_height \* filter_width larger than filter_matrix.

If there is a need for such an op but no plans to implement it in the immediate future, I'm happy to look into adding it.

4540,error when using embedding_lookup with random initial embeddings,"Hi all. I'm working on variable-length sequence data. eg. a sequence `data = np.array([4,2,3,2,0,-1,-1])`(padded to length 7, the real sequence length is 5). They are word ids. So I can get word embeddings through `tf.nn.embedding_lookup`. 

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
import cPickle


vocab_size = 105374
embed_dim = 200
input_x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[7], name=""x"")
embedding_matrix = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[vocab_size, embed_dim], name=""embeddings"")
with tf.device(""/cpu:0""), tf.variable_scope(""embedding""):
    embedded_inputs = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix, input_x)


## Test
data = np.array([4,2,3,2,0,-1,-1])
embedding_path = os.path.join(""/home/lan/data/dataset-TSU"", ""IMDB"", ""embinit.save"")
with open(embedding_path, 'rb') as f:
    embed_init = cPickle.load(f)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
    print sess.run(embedded_inputs, feed_dict={input_x:data, embedding_matrix:embed_init})
```

If I use `placeholder` to hold my pre-trained word vectors `embinit.save`, `id = -1` is ok to work.
I got result from the code above like that. As I expected, the last two ids are both -1, which cannot be found in word embedding matrix. So it returned all zeros.

```
[[ 0.26877201  0.239695   -0.08297    ..., -0.030947    0.199618
  -0.24129499]
 [ 0.115232    0.123859   -0.055312   ..., -0.040216    0.176268   -0.259417  ]
 [ 0.132403    0.134068   -0.059557   ..., -0.010268    0.16242801
  -0.240173  ]
 ..., 
 [ 0.20500401  0.125486   -0.116052   ...,  0.066659    0.15658499
  -0.227872  ]
 [ 0.          0.          0.         ...,  0.          0.          0.        ]
 [ 0.          0.          0.         ...,  0.          0.          0.        ]]
```

But if I randomly initialized word embedding matrix, like that 

```
vocab_size = 105374
embed_dim = 200
input_x = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.int32, shape=[7], name=""x"")
with tf.device(""/cpu:0""), tf.variable_scope(""embedding""):
    embedding_matrix = tf.get_variable(name=""embedding_matrix"",
                                            dtype=tf.float32,
                                            shape=[vocab_size,embed_dim],
                                            initializer=tf.random_uniform_initializer(-1.0, 1.0))
    embedded_inputs = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix, input_x)
```

I got such an error:

```
tensorflow.python.framework.errors.InvalidArgumentError: indices[5] = -1 is not in [0, 105374)
```

That's to say I cannot use id=-1 in this way. Why?? Is there any solution?

4539,Clarification about embedding_attention_seq2seq,"This would qualify as a bug depending on what was the intention behind writing the code, the way it was written and whether I understand the workings of Tensorflow well enough.

The [`cell` input](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py#L755) given to
`embedding_attention_seq2seq` function in [seq2seq.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py)  seems to be used both by [the encoder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py#L811) and by [the decoder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py#L832). Internally, the EmbeddingWrapper class just does [`self._cell = cell`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell.py#L717)  which means that it does not create a copy of the cell. Doesn't this mean that the decoder and encoder end up sharing the parameters of their respective LSTMs? is this intentional?

EDIT: realized why they're different cells: because of the scopes.

4536,Convolutional RNN/LSTM,"Hi all,

This is a feature request for Convolutional RNNs such as [Convolutional LSTMS](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04214v2.pdf). Is there any plan to support them in tensorflow?

I have an implementation working in [here](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/Convolutional-LSTM-in-Tensorflow) and some basic results indicating how well they do. I went about implementing them by making a new class called `ConvRNNCell` and `BasicVONVLSTMCell` and following what is seen in the tensorflow `rnn_cell.py` file. It seems I could redo the whole `rnn_cell.py` file like this. 

If this is of interest I would be more then happy to implement it for all the rnn functions.

It's not possible to reset a queue unless you have multiple sessions. How about resetting it when you have a single session?

**Use case:**
In a single session, if one would want to run _exactly_ one epoch (where epoch_size%batch_size!=0) of a model _x_ times and report it's result exactly after one full and single epoch. It would be convenient if one could restart the queues.

I need to implement a network with locally connected layers (convolution without weight sharing) with 2D inputs (images).

I was wondering if the implementation of this feature is on the roadmap or if there exists some clever hacks using existing TF functions to do it.

I installed tensorflow around two monthes ago and I've used it.
Then, I tried to update by following [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34239537/how-to-update-tensorflow-from-source).

I first tried 'git pull', it could not be merged since I have some changes in source.
So I reset the source by

```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Then I did `./configure`. But it gives errors. I attached the output of the configure below.
It's weird because I successfully update with this way before.
Actually, I also tried same way in another system (Cuda 7.0 cuDNN 4), but failed with similar error message...

I've also looked at the fixes such as this one https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/419 which either remove -lpthread from google protobuf or link to the dummy lib but these seem to only apply to earlier versions of TensorFlow.

Apologies if this is a basic config error, I'm new to Bazel and am pretty stuck. benchmark_model and quantize_graph both compile well independently but not yet for me when combined.

4526,GPU-resident queue for prefetching over PCIe,"It would improve performance in some cases to be able to asynchronously prefetch data over the PCIe bus while GPU computation is taking place. A GPU-resident queue seems like the natural way to achieve this.

In the SO thread below, @yaroslavvb mentions using Variables pinned to the GPU to achieve the same effect, but I was unable to find a way to get this to work.

4519,raw_rnn,"For @ebrevdo on his new [raw_rnn implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py#L1018).

In your [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py#L1064)

When you define `next_input` as the following:

``` python
elements_finished = (time >= sequence_length)
...
next_input = tf.cond(
    finished,
    lambda: tf.zeros([batch_size, input_depth], dtype=tf.float32),
    lambda: inputs_ta.read(time))
```

Why make it return an zero input? Will this not cause the last state to be computed incorrectly (with zeros as input)?

Alternatively the zero input can be removed, by rewriting it the following way

``` python
elements_finished = (time >= (sequence_length-1))
...
next_input = inputs_ta.read(time)
```

Thanks

4518,GPU kernel for MatrixTriangularSolve ,"A feature request. This should be possible without too much disruption because it relies on a CUBLAS call and therefore would not require changes to stream_executor, see section 3.4.6 of the linked document. 

https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/cuda/files/Misc/mygpu.pdf

The requisite blas function is called _cublasStrsm_ and seems to be already in stream executor in this file

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6d04d601e9e8758ec4642fa9d548b7321d804d63/tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_blas.cc

I know that @rmlarsen has been interested in this sort of area in the past. 

I don't think it is possible to do this as a user op added at run time because stream executor is not part of the tf includes in the binary, but I'd be happy to be wrong.

4517,Documentation: add warning to GPU setup instructions that Intel not supported,"This is obvious in retrospect and isn't TF specific, but it might save some people some time to say something like ""Tensorflow only supports CUDA, which is proprietary to NVIDIA, and not all Macs have an NVIDIA GPU"".
"
4516,Interface improvement suggestions for tf.tranpose and tf.slice,"I would like to suggest the following improvements for the interfaces of `tf.transpose` and `tf.slice`.
1. `tf.transpose` currently accepts a boolean mask that selects the dimensions to be reversed. AFAIK this is the only op in Tensorflow that uses a mask for this purpose, whereas other, e.g. `tf.reduce_***`, take an axis number or a list of axis numbers. I think `tf.tranpose` could also be changed accordingly.
2. `tf.slice` signature is `tf.slice(input_, begin, size, name=None)`, and it is very unusual for Python that the slices are defined by their size, not by their end. Also, there is a `slice` object in Python, which would be a very natural argument for `tf.slice`.

4493,Tensorflow Bazel build error,"Hello,

I was pointed here from StackOverflow, hopefully I am in the right place.

I have been trying to setup tensorflow on my Raspberry Pi 3B using the guide [here](https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi/blob/master/GUIDE.md). However I run into an error when executing the command:

4474,Feature request: Patch extracting given location implementation needed.,"Hello there,
## Feature

I consider a lot but finally decide put this request here.
I know there are some matrix operation and image operations like `image_patch_extract` and `image.extract_glimpse()`.
But what I want is extract the patches given several locations.

Input Tensor: 

``` python
         batch image: [batch_size, image_height, image_width, image_channel]
         batch locations: [batch_size, num_patches, 2]
```

Output Tensor: 

``` python
        [batch_size, num_patches, patch_height, patch_width, image_channel]
or 
        [batch_size * num_patches, patch_height, patch_width, image_channel]
```
## Reference:

Georgis have done the similar thing and he made the a patch in v0.8.0 and only cpu supports.

```
https://github.com/trigeorgis/tensorflow
```

But when I use it in v0.10.0, it requires me to define a shape function. 
I really want to use it in the future, so I am glad it can be added as a new feature.
## Other solution I tried

I have tried use `extract_glimpse()` instead.

``` python
output_list = [[] for _ in range(batch_size)]   # create n_patch list
locations = locations/image_size  # normalize the location
for j in range(n_patch):
    patch_one = tf.image.glimpse(batch_image, tf.constant([20, 20]), locations[:, j, :], centered=False)
    for i in range(batch_size):
          output_list[i].append(patch_one[j])  # add tensor to each list
patches = tf.pack(output_list)  # pack the list to tensor, size = [batch_size, n_patch, patch_size, patch_height, image_channel]
```

4473,Make the gradient computation available in the C api,"When writing TensorFlow bindings for other languages, a major difficulty is that the C api does not give a simple way to add gradient computations to a graph. In the case of the [tensorflow-ocaml](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml) bindings, we ended up re-implementing back-propagation and having to register gradients for many operators. Providing support for this in the C api would allow us to remove all this code.

There is already a [todo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/c/c_api.h#L505) for this in the code but having a proper issue would make this easier to track.

Can we have a `tf.write_file` as well?

It could be defined as something like:

``` python
def write_file(tensor, filename, name=None):
    def write_data(data):
        with open(filename, ""wb"") as handle:
            handle.write(data)

    with tf.name_scope(""WriteFile"" or name):
        tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(tensor, name=""Values"")
        return tf.py_func(write_data, tensor)
```

There are some usecases where this would be helpful, such as generating images and audio and then writing them to disk. Presumably, this would be done after an op such as `encode_jpeg` or `encode_audio`.

If this already exists in some form, please close this – my apologies, but some googling as well as searching on Github did not find it.

4466,Android: Why is RandomShuffleQueue needed for testing?,"Hello, 

I want to test a learnt model under Python on android, I'm on Tensorflow 0.9.
To do so, I freezed my graph to have a single pb file with the graph and weight. I used Queues to manage my learning batches.

When running my session on Android, I specify the input tensor by its name ""input_node"", which is the data layer as input in my network. 
X = tf.reshape(X, [-1, W, H, 1], name=""input_node"")
and call the ""output_node"" layer : 
output = tf.reshape(h_fc11, shape=[-1, 8], name=""output_node"")

The batch generation is done before, so it should not been used when testing.
But I have the following error:
tensorflow_jni.cc:312 Error during inference: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'RandomShuffleQueue' with these attrs
[[Node: shuffle_batch/random_shuffle_queue = RandomShuffleQueue[capacity=10750, component_types=[DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT], container="""", min_after_dequeue=10000, seed=0, seed2=0, shapes=[[10000], [8]], shared_name=""""]()]]

It seems that the batch generation layer is called (my images are 100x100 and I have 8 outputs), but I don't know why.

When testing the same model with the same input/output layers though the image_labelling.cc directly on Mac (building with Bazel), I don't have the error.

I do not understand why the RandomShuffleQueue is needed when testing. Am I missing something to specify the part of the graph I want to use? Are all the layers of the graph verified even if not used?

`# TODO(mrry): Move this to where it is used, so we can get rid of this op wrapper?`
in the [state_ops.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/state_ops.py#L151)

So, I searched and found that only `variables.py` calls it twice times [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py#L305), and [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py#L322).

BTW, some `xx_test.py` also call it, but I think it's easy to change. 
In a word, could I handle the issue and update all the files?@mrry 

I output the file list which call the `variable_op()`:

```
Variables.py
Variables_test.py
Variable_ops_test.py
Tensor_util_test.py
Moving_averages_test.py
Learning_rate_decay_test.py
Graph_util_test.py

4451,TensorFlow demo app crashes with my own model,"### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1269
### Environment info

Operating System: Linux ubuntu

If installed from source, provide 
1. The commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`) 
   ce3572a08b9ecfa5c8dd94921c2011f37b58e608
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)
1. Followin this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html
   I built a model via transfer learning using custom images. 
2. I edited WORKSPACE and built demo.apk
   App crashed.
3. Then i used inception5h.zip  as referenced in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android.
   The app run without any problem.
### What other attempted solutions have you tried?

Then i looked at issue https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1269 for guidance.
1.    ---Edited tensorflowImagelistener.java---

``` java
  private static final int NUM_CLASSES = 4; //1001;
  private static final int INPUT_SIZE = 299; //224
  private static final int IMAGE_MEAN = 128; //117
  private static final float IMAGE_STD = 128; //1;
  private static final String INPUT_NAME = ""Mul:0""; //""input:0""; 
  private static final String OUTPUT_NAME = ""final_result:0""; //""output:0"";
```
1. ---I even stripped the graph using strip_unused.py using ----

``` sh
  bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:strip_unused
  bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/strip_unused --input_graph=/tmp/inception.pb   --output_graph=/tmp/stripped_inception.pb --input_node_names=""Mul:0"" --output_node_names=""final_result"" --input_binary=true
```
1. --In strip_unused_lib.py i added if else clause as referenced by @dmirk quick-n-dirty from #1269---

``` python
      if ""jpeg"" in node.op.lower():
        placeholder_node.attr[""dtype""].CopyFrom(tf.AttrValue(
            type=tf.uint8.as_datatype_enum))
      else:
        placeholder_node.attr[""dtype""].CopyFrom(tf.AttrValue(
            type=placeholder_type_enum))
```
1. For some reason i still got this error. See attached 
   [oldlogcat.txt](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/479719/oldlogcat.txt)

``` sh
tensorflow_jni.cc:304 Error during inference: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DecodeJpeg' with these attrs.  Registered kernels:
```
1. As a last resort i did this modification to tensorflow_jni.cc as referenced in #1269. See attached [logcat.txt](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/479718/logcat.txt)

``` cc
      // Copy 3 values
      input_tensor_mapped(0, i, j, 0) =
          (static_cast<float>(src->red) - g_image_mean) / g_image_mean;//g_image_std;
      input_tensor_mapped(0, i, j, 1) =
          (static_cast<float>(src->green) - g_image_mean) / g_image_mean;//g_image_std;
      input_tensor_mapped(0, i, j, 2) =
          (static_cast<float>(src->blue) - g_image_mean) / g_image_mean;//g_image_std;
```

but i think this dint help any much. however i dint find the opkernel error

4444,Code snippet in the TensorFlow for Poets codelab is confusing,"Based on [this](http://stackoverflow.com/q/39562938/3574081) Stack Overflow question.

In [section 5](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#4), the first `python` command has a leading `#`:

``` bash
# python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \
--bottleneck_dir=/tf_files/bottlenecks \
--how_many_training_steps 500 \
--model_dir=/tf_files/inception \
--output_graph=/tf_files/retrained_graph.pb \
--output_labels=/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt \
--image_dir /tf_files/flower_photos
```

The second one doesn't:

``` bash
python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \
--bottleneck_dir=/tf_files/bottlenecks \
--model_dir=/tf_files/inception \
--output_graph=/tf_files/retrained_graph.pb \
--output_labels=/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt \
--image_dir /tf_files/flower_photos
```

If you copy and paste the first command, you'll get an unintuitive error like `""--bottleneck_dir=/tf_files/bottlenecks: No such file or directory""`. We should remove the leading `#` or somehow make it clearer (and consistent across both snippets) that this is a shell prompt.

4443,Breaking change of `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` in v0.10: bug or feature,"When dealing with sequences of different lengths and RNNs, it is very common to pad ""out-of-range"" part of the input sequence. More than that, labels should also be padded. It is convenient to pad labels with bogus value `-1` and not introducing any new valid label values.

Prior to version 0.10, `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` returned `0.0` for logits that correspond to `-1` labels. These cross-entropy values thus weren't influencing calculation of loss, effectively being ignored. 

Somewhere along the way between v0.9 and v0.10 this behavior has changed, and:
- `nan` is now being returned for logits that correspond to `-1` labels
- gradient calculation results in `nan`

New behavior silently breaks the code that rely on the assumption that zero cross-entropy will be returned and valid gradients will be calculated in case of labels `-1` .

The goal of this issue is to discuss the possibility and practicability of reverting to the old behavior, i.e.:
- returning `0.0` for logits that correspond to `-1` labels
- fixing gradient computation

I would also like to point out that it would be very good to document changes, that could potentially break user code, in the release notes (in the section ""breaking changes""). 

<sub>Sad story: in my case, it took some time to understand what's happening. Current version of documentation says that passing `-1` labels is illegal and leads to incorrect gradient calculations. It was not the case when I've written my code. I couldn't know about this change, as I cannot possibly re-read all the documentation every time I update tensorflow. I spent about 2 weeks exploring NaN loss and thought it's a gradient explosion. I almost threw away a perfectly good model. Advice for future me: if stuck, read the docs AGAIN ;) </sub>

4442,predict function loads only the first batch from the input_fn,"I have a regular `input_fn_valid` function. 
When using `estimator.evaluate(input_fn=input_fn_valid)` everything is OK and the model is evaluated on the whole dataset. But calling `probs = estimator.predict(input_fn=input_fn_valid)` only returns the predicted values of the first batch (The size of `probs` is equal to `batch_size` parameter).

Is it a bug in the predict function?

4434,Why is quantized graph inference takes much more time than using the original graph?,"I followed this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/quantization/index.html) in order to quantize my graph into 8 bit.I can't share the exact graph here but i can say it's a simple convolutional neural network.

When i run the [benchmark tool](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/benchmark) over the original and quantized networks it's clear that the quantized network is much much slower (100 ms vs. 4.5 ms).

Slowest nodes in original network :

4431,"Forward mode ad, directional derivatives","Say I have `outputs = f(inputs)` and `g` of the same shape as `inputs`. I'd like to compute the directional derivative of `outputs` with respect to `inputs` in the direction `g` - in other words, the derivative of `f(inputs + alpha * g)` with respect to `alpha` at the point `alpha=0`.

This is a straightforward application of forward-mode automatic differentiation, which should be pretty easy to implement (much easier than the already-implemented reverse-mode ad). Are there any plans to add this feature?

4427,Clarify math or paper reference behind AttentionCellWrapper,"The documentation for `AttentionCellWrapper` in contrib states that it's based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06733). However, the attention mechanism in the paper appears to be distinct from that in `AttentionCellWrapper`. For example the TF implementation involves convolutions and requires a fixed attention window, neither of which are a feature of the referenced paper. I suggest that either the correct paper is referenced, or the description is updated to reflect the actual math being implemented. The biggest issue right now is that it's unclear what the various options really mean (`attn_length`, `attn_size`, `attn_vec_size`, etc) as their descriptions are very concise and without a paper reference to ground what the documentation is referring to, it's impossible to know what the attention mechanism is doing short of going through the code line-by-line.

  var = tf.Variable(0)
  count = var.count_up_to(3)
  tf.initialize_all_variables().run()
  print(var.eval())
  print(count.eval())
  print(var.eval())
```

Expected output:

```
0
1
1
```

What I see instead:

```
0
0
1
```

For some reason, the tensor from `tf.count_up_to` evaluates to the old value instead of the updated value.

4423,set_shape cause gradient error in a condition case,"### Environment info

Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04

If installed from binary pip package, provide:
1. A link to the pip package you installed: [https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl)
2. The output from `python -c ""import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)""`. 0.10.0rc0
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

``` python
import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.ones((2, 1, 2))
a_ = tf.cond(tf.equal(tf.shape(a)[1], 1), lambda: tf.tile(a, (1, 5, 1)), lambda: a)
a_.set_shape([None, 5, None])
tf.gradients(a_, a)
# => ValueError: Shapes (2, 5, 2) and (2, 1, 2) are not compatible
```

If the set_shape line is removed, everything works fine

``` python
tf.gradients(a_, a)
# => [<tf.Tensor 'gradients_5/AddN:0' shape=(2, 1, 2) dtype=float32>]
```

I'm using EC2 G2.8XL instances. These instances have:
1. Intel Xeon E5-2670 (Sandy Bridge) Processors
2. 60 GB memory and
3. Four GK104GL [GRID K520] GPU with 4 GB memory on each of them. 
4. 10 Gigabit NIC

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS on these machines.

I'm running one worker per GPU. So, in total there is **16 workers**. 
I'm running one PS per machine. So, **4 PS** in total. 

I'm using a **batch size of 8**. (4 machines run out of memory with a batch size of 8. 32 machines run out of memory even with a batch size of 2).

4419,tf.get_variable without an explicit initializer fails for integer types,"The following fails (shape and name are arbitrary):

```
tf.get_variable(name='foo', shape=(42,), dtype=tf.int32)
```

Exception: `TypeError: Expected int32, got -1.7320508075688772 of type 'float' instead.`

In contrast, using `tf.float32` works just fine.

The problem appears to be https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/variable_scope.py#L658

If an initializer is not provided (and a default one is not set), a uniform unit scaling init is used (notice that [`sqrt(3)==1.7320...`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py#L275)), which of course conflicts with the requested integer type.

While this can be mitigated by doing something like:

```
tf.get_variable(name='foo', dtype=tf.int32, initializer=tf.zeros_initializer(shape=(42,), dtype=tf.int32))
```

it feels like a smarter default behavior based on the variable type is warranted (or at least a less cryptic error).

Tested on the current master.

4413,Unexpected behaviour for tf.InteractiveSession() in Jupyter Notebook,"I'm not convinced this is a bug, but if I run `tf.InteractiveSession()` in a cell with no assignment (e.g. `sess = tf.InteractiveSession()`), the interactive session will work only as long as the call is the last operation in the notebook cell and the output is not suppressed with `;`. This tripped me over a few times, so I'm reporting it just in case this is not the intended behaviour.

FWIW I think this is because IPython/Jupyter stores the session automatically in the cases I highlighted, making the command alike `sess = tf.InteractiveSession()` which works as expected.
### Environment info

Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: Using CPU version

If installed from binary pip package, provide:
1. A link to the pip package you installed: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
2. The output from `python -c ""import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)""`. 0.10.0
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

I open a Jupyter notebook, and this works:

``` python
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf
In [2]: tf.InteractiveSession()
In [3]: tf.constant(0).eval()
```

This doesn't:

``` python
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf
In [2]: tf.InteractiveSession();
In [3]: tf.constant(0).eval()
```

Neither does this one:

``` python
In [1]: import tensorflow as tf
In [2]: tf.InteractiveSession()
        print()
In [3]: tf.constant(0).eval()
```

The both fail with:

4408,Variable initialization problem,"Hi, I am getting a error ""Attempting to use uninitialized value"" on tf.initialize_all_variables when I try to incorporate the shape of a tensor via tf.shape in a loss function that depends on a dynamically shaped input tensor, and in between, on the variable that does not get initialized and on tf.scan. I am trying to get a minimal working example of the bug, but I couldn't reproduce it yet, so I thought I would ask whether this or a similar issue is already known before I continue. The only reproducible step is that the initialization works when I replace tf.to_float(tf.shape(x))[0] in my loss function with tf.constant(1.0), which makes me believe it has something to do with tf.shape or perhaps with the tf.scan.

(3) Placeholders
The functionality is neat but I require better performance..

If I were to do this myself, what are from a performance standpoint be the main differences between (1) and (2). In any case, it would be great if (1) ended up in the master branch.

### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.client import timeline

start = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.float64)
end = tf.constant(100, dtype=tf.float64)
init = tf.ones([100], dtype=tf.float64)
b = tf.ones([100], dtype=tf.float64)

def condForWhile(i, a):
    return tf.less(i, end)

def bodyForWhile(i, a):
    i = i + 1
    a = tf.mul(a, b)
    return [i, a]

_, prod = tf.while_loop(condForWhile, bodyForWhile, [start, init])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    tf.initialize_all_variables().run()
    # run once to eliminate start-up costs
    sess.run(prod)
    # now run with tracing
    run_metadata = tf.RunMetadata()
    result = sess.run(prod,
        options=tf.RunOptions(trace_level=tf.RunOptions.FULL_TRACE),
        run_metadata=run_metadata)

trace = timeline.Timeline(step_stats=run_metadata.step_stats)
trace_file = open('/tmp/timeline.tfwhile.json', 'w')
trace_file.write(trace.generate_chrome_trace_format(show_dataflow=False, show_memory=False))

This is a simple app that does a = a \* b 100 times in a while_loop using the tf.mul() operator. I am using the timeline feature to profile it. Inspecting the timeline shows that for each iteration, the time in the gpu stream for the multiply is about .003ms, but the time between launches is .3ms-.5ms. This seems like a lot - is that expected? 

Note that my while condition uses floats in the less function. I see the less operation happening on the gpu stream and a memcpyDtoH time for each loop iteration presumably to copy the loop counter back and forth to the gpu, which seems kind of inefficient. If instead I use  type int64 in the loop conditions (start and end), then the gap between kernels goes down to .11 - .17ms and I no longer see the less on the gpu stream or the memcpy. 

Note that in the original case where we discovered this, our gpu operator was much more complicated (and uses floats in the condition) and the time between kernel launches was still relatively constant at around .4ms. In contrast, if I write this same app in straight cuda, and launch the kernel 100 times in cuda, the gap between launches is about .007ms (about 50x improvement). I would expect some overhead in the tensorflow conditional operators, but this really seems like a lot. 
### Logs or other output that would be helpful

Is there any specific protobuf commit id to be used with TensorFlow?
We could build TensorFlow without making any change in `tensorflow/workspace.bzl` and manually adding fix for 64 bit platform in  `external/protobuf/src/google/protobuf/stubs/atomicops_internals_generic_gcc.h` .

We need to use protobuf with commit id [c59473d](https://github.com/google/protobuf/commit/c59473d53eafadd126502657e5c5c33e952b67ed) or recent , where a fix for 64 bit platform has been committed.

4361,Update tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm() docs,"_Tensorflow version that I use : 0.10 (pip package)_

---

I took heavy use of _[tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm()](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b826b79718e3e93148c3545e7aa3f90891744cc0/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py#L100)_ the last weeks. 

After facing some problems on how to use it correctly, I figured out that there are many devs out there who are confused as well, such as here:
- https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1122
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33949786/how-could-i-use-batch-normalization-in-tensorflow

I would suggest to do following improvements to make it more clear:

**1) Update example in doc-string:**

The example tells in case we use _update_collections_ on its defaults, we have to include this:

```
update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)
if update_ops:
    updates = tf.group(update_ops)
    total_loss = control_flow_ops.with_dependencies([updates], total_loss)
```

But this is actually not working or deprecated, as it throws errors. Instead, we have to do some tiny changes. I would suggest to update the docs as follows:

```
from tensorflow.python import control_flow_ops

update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)
if update_ops:
    updates = tf.tuple(update_ops)
    total_loss = control_flow_ops.with_dependencies(updates, total_loss)
```

As a side question, why do we apply it to the _total_loss_, and not to the train_op directly, as described in the doc-string text. Added a dependency to _total_loss_ works, but grouping it with the _train_op_ would make the example more clear in my opinion, because we do batch-statistic updates only during training.

**2) _UPDATE_OPS_ in combination with reuse varscope:**

This is related to the question above. Let's say we have a model with which reuses an convolutional encoder (and also its batch-norm-layers) several times. Even when we reuse these layers, the update operation for the batch-statistics is added to _UPDATE_OPS_ nevertheless. Personally, I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if this is really what should be done?
Or is it required to filter the update-ops after collecting them with `update_ops = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)`, so that each one is executed just once?

To sum this up: Am I wrong that lines 213-215 should not be executed when reuse=True? So changing it to:

```
if not reuse:
    # Collect the updates to be computed later.
    ops.add_to_collections(updates_collections, update_moving_mean)
    ops.add_to_collections(updates_collections, update_moving_variance)
```

In my case, I'm using a Conv-LSTM-Conv_tp architecture, where I reuse the Conv/Conv_tp for each timestep. When I increase the number of timesteps in the LSTM, the number of update-ops increases in proportionally, while the number of model-parameters stays constant because they get reused. Currently, I'm getting 420 update-ops when calling `tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)`. As the performance feels super slow when I use batch-norm, I guess this high number of update-ops cannot be right.

**3) Handling of _is_training_ parameter:**

I have seen a lot of examples people doing something like this in their code to handle the _is_training_ parameter:

```
def batch_norm_layer(x,train_phase,scope_bn):
    bn_train = batch_norm(x, decay=0.999, center=True, scale=True,
    updates_collections=None,
    is_training=True)
    bn_inference = batch_norm(x, decay=0.999, center=True, scale=True,
    updates_collections=None,
    is_training=False)
    bn = tf.cond(train_phase, lambda: bn_train, lambda: bn_inference)
    return bn
```

As far as I know, this was really required in the past, because is_training was just a Boolean. But since the param can be a Bool-Tensor as well, this is not required anymore. Since many devs are still ding this workaound, added a comment to the doc-string that this is not required anymore could be helpful.

**4) Usage on Multi-GPU configuration**

a) When I optimize my code for multi-GPU systems (as in the CIFAR10 example) the number of update-ops increases with the factor of num_gpus (might be related to 2) ).

b) When I use _tf.contrib.batch_norm()_ within a multi-GPU system, I get an error like this:

```
InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device to node 'tower_1/inference/ConvStack/x_bn_9/moments/sufficient_statistics/SparseToDense': 
Could not satisfy explicit device specification '/device:GPU:1' because no supported kernel 
for GPU devices is available.
...
```

Hence, to we have to wrap evey _batch_norm()_ call with _tf.device(""/cpu:0"")_? I guess this might have bad impacts on performance, right?

Thanks!

_PS: Sorry in case this question would fits better to StackOverflow. As it is a combination of suggested improvements and questions. Just let me know..._

Using 0.3.1 avoids this and reverting the offending commit 7bcdcbbf60fc08346fd8016270a0563f4b51362b also fixes it.

### Fix

Upgrade to 0.3.1, obviously. However, since 0.3.0 is still officially supported, I thought this deserves to be an issue.

Another fix is to revert the commit 7bcdcbbf60fc08346fd8016270a0563f4b51362b. Note, I didn't have to revert to its parent; undoing that commit alone is enough:

4333,dynamic_rnn() cannot receive an input of dynamic shape during training,"Hi all, I met some problem when using dynamic_rnn() and wonder if there is any solution.

Firstly I sort all examples according to its length(variable length input). Then I use ""batch padding"" in my code. So in each step during training, data generator generates a padded minibatch, whose shape differ from the last batch. And I feed the minibatch data to the graph. Since the placeholder ""inputs"" in graph has an uncertain shape, it raised an error when tensor flows to `dynamic_rnn()` node. If I specify the placeholder's shape, everything is ok.

Now `dynamic_rnn()` can only receive inputs with a fixed shape. How can I combine it with ""batch padding""?

Thanks!
"
4332,Tensor with inconsistent dimension size? ,"I've been implementing a convolutional neural network for object detection and I met the issue below:

For object detection task, usually, one input image is associated with an undetermined number of object bounding boxes. Each bounding box can be represented by 4 coordinates. Thus, to represent bounding boxes as a tensor, the shape will be: 
    _[**batch_size, variable_num_bbox(?), 4**]_. 
Note that here, it's not just that _**variable_num_bbox**_ can't be determined before the graph construction, but also, even within one batch input, different images can have different numbers of bounding boxes. 

As an illustrative example, I would like to convert the following array into a tensor: 
    _[[[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5]], [[3, 4, 5, 6]]]_
Here, _**variable_num_bbox**_ is 2 for the first image, but it's 1 for the second image. 

I've tried and failed several ways to convert the above nested list to a tensor, which leads me to the question whether tensorflow support tensors with inconsistent dimension size? If no, is there any plan to support it to give developers such flexibility? And if it's not going to be supported, is there a way to by-pass this issue for object detection task? One solution would be to set _**batch_size=1**_ , and a bounding box can be represented as _**[variable_num_bbox(?), 4]**_, so yes, the dimension inconsistency is gone, but that will hurt the efficiencyy significantly.

It seems to me that there might be some bug in the `tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou`since all the variables are already initialised.

I am using it as follows:

```
accuracy_increment, iou_increment = self.session.run(
                [self.accuracy, self.mean_iou], feed_dict={
                self.X: eval_patches[
                        q * self.microbatch_size:
                        q * self.microbatch_size +
                        self.microbatch_size],
                self.Y: eval_labels[
                        q * self.microbatch_size:
                        q * self.microbatch_size +
                        self.microbatch_size],
                self.p_keep_conv: 1})
```

And the mean iou is computed in the object as:

```
self.mean_iou, _ = tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou(
            self.predictions, tf.argmax(self.Y, dimension=3), num_classes=2)
```

I am using from source build tensorflow (branch r10.0) and it's happening to me on both CPU and GPU.

I am not 100% sure that I am using the `tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou` correctly, but I have played with that a lot, but there is quite lack of the documentation, so I am currently stuck assuming that there is either some bug in the `tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_mean_iou` or not enough documentation for me to make it work.

I thank in advance anyone for any comments.

4330,overparametrized convolution error in tf.nn.separable_conv2d ,"I'm trying to build a network of layers with channel-wise separable convolution. (Just like the paper [Factorized CNN](http://128.84.21.199/abs/1608.04337))

I've found that separable_conv2d and depthwise_conv2d is the two options, and I'm trying out these two.

What I am trying to build is as below

```
depthwise_filter = tf.get_variable(""depth_conv_w"", [3,3,64,3], initialize=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=np.sqrt(2.0/9/32)))
pointwise_filter = tf.get_variable(""point_conv_w"", [1,1,192,64], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=np.sqrt(2.0/9/128)))
conv_tensor = tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d(tensor, depthwise_filter, [1,1,1,1], padding='SAME')
conv_tensor = tf.nn.conv2d(conv_tensor, pointwise_filter, [1,1,1,1], padding='VALID')
```

and it works fine.

However, if I switch the last 2 lines with

```
conv_tensor=tf.nn.separable_conv2d(tensor,depthwise_filter,pointwise_filter,[1,1,1,1],padding='SAME')
```

then tensorflow gives me 'overparamatrized convolution error' as specified in [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/nn.py#L705)

I think **channel_multiplier \* in_channel** is usually larger than or equal to the **out_channel**.
So I believe this is an error.

PS) I can get the same result as the **separable_conv2d** with **depthwise_conv2d and 1x1 convolution**. Is there any advantage of using **separable_conv2d**?

4324,can't find module tensorflow after building 'quantize_graph',"Hi,

I followed this [blog post](https://petewarden.com/2016/05/03/how-to-quantize-neural-networks-with-tensorflow/) in order build the tool for quantizing graph (tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools/quantize_graph).
I had a clean working version of tensorflow installed properly.

I used this command in order to build the quantization tool :
**bazel build tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph**

It seems that the build went ok :

To help with triaging, here's the paper that motivates elu activation: [Fast and Accurate Deep Network Learning by Exponential Linear Units (ELUs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07289)

To summarize, the dependencies that are included inside the `if_android` and `if_ios` are not found. They don't exist in the repository, so that is not that surprising. What is more surprising though is that my vanilla installation is not returning empty lists when `if_android` is called. I haven't looked into how those functions work, so not sure why that is happening.
### Environment info

Setup: CentOS, Bazel 0.3.1, CUDA 7.5, CuDNN 5.1, Tensorflow master (dbe7ee0dfa9e5ab26284522379f2747510fc267b)

I run `configure` and set it up for GPU support. Actually, I don't think this is criticial, but first I had to open up `configure` and add `--output_base=...` on the two calls to `bazel`, since my setup requires a custom cache directory.
### Fix

The `if_...` lines were added in ed87884e50e1a50f7dc7b36dc7a7ff225442bee0, so a fix that I know works is to use its parent commit 7705791619f5e851687e9a63b4315087e189f8be.

4311,Configure takes a lot of time and resources ,"in the last few weeks I notice that while developing operations for tensorflow I find myself doing ./configure many more times and each time takes few minutes on a good internet connection.

Can we cache some of the artifacts ? Do we have to remove all the time the complete protobuf repository ? How is this handled internally at google ? 
"
4309,"In-place operations (dropout, ReLU, etc..)","As far as I understand, tensorflow does not support in-place operation of operations such as ReLU, Dropout, etc..

If an operation outputs the same type and shape tensor and does not involve any branching in the graph then it should be possible to operate on the same chunk of memory.

As it stands, tensorflow doesn't support this which severely increases memory usage for large deep learning models.

4291,Tensor slice is too large to serialize,"Hi,
I met a issue said that ""**Tensor slice is too large to serialize** (conservative estimate: 2268204567 bytes)"". And i am wondered that why there is a limitation to prevents the TensorSliceWriter from attempting to serialize variables that are larger than 2GB. How can I to skip this limitation if I want to use a variable large than 2GB? 

Thanks

4290,Aspect Preserving Image Downsample That does not Require Cropping,"Right now it looks like all of the image downsize (ie resize to a smaller size) operations involve either changing aspect ratio (e.g. [resize_images](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/image.html#resize_images)) or cropping (e.g. [resize_image_with_crop_or_pad](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/image.html#resize_image_with_crop_or_pad)). Compare this to the [thumbnail operation in Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail) that maintains the aspect ratio but does not crop.

4283,Breaking API change without deprecation warning,"### Problem

The name_scope API has changed between last week and last night's latest changes in the 0.10 branch. The previous API was:

```
name_scope(*args, **kwds)
```

The current API is:

```
name_scope(name)
```

The API was changed in a breaking way, rather than the new API being added and the use of the old API triggering a warning.

I was wondering what the TensorFlow gatekeepers' policy is on breaking API changes. Is there an official policy? Is the breaking change without a deprecation warning and phase-out intentional?

4282,Unspecified dimension after tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul,"### Environment info

Operating System:

Problem encountered on linux CPU build installed from `47501a5ebc62fcb8a3d7832722d39997696897dc`.  
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

```
import tensorflow as tf
indices = [[0, 0], [1, 2]]
values = [1., 1.]
shape = [4, 6]
test_sparse = tf.SparseTensor(indices, values, shape)
v = tf.ones((6, 1))

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())

mult = tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul(test_sparse, v)
print(mult)
--> <tf.Tensor 'SparseTensorDenseMatMul_1/SparseTensorDenseMatMul:0' shape=(?, 1) dtype=float32>

# but of course
sess.run(mult).shape
--> (4, 1)
```

My question is: why is it that the shape of `mult` is partially unspecified before run time? It can be inferred from the shape of `test_sparse` and `v` that `mult` will have shape `(4, 1)`. 

This is very annoying because it prevents me from initializing a Variable with the result of a sparse matmul as in the following:

```
mult_val = tf.Variable(tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul(test_sparse, v))
--> ValueError: initial_value must have a shape specified: Tensor(""SparseTensorDenseMatMul/SparseTensorDenseMatMul:0"", shape=(?, 1), dtype=float32)
```

On the other hand, dense matmul has the desired behavior:

```
dense_mult = tf.matmul(tf.sparse_tensor_to_dense(test_sparse, v))
dense_mult.get_shape()
--> TensorShape([Dimension(4), Dimension(1)])
```

So why does sparse matmul behave differently? Is this a bug? An implementation quirk? 

In the meanwhile, how can I initialize a Variable with the result of a sparse matmul without having to densify the sparse matrix first?

4281,Seq2Seq example - shape error while decoding,"When I try to run the tutorial available at [https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) it works great. The model is training and the proximity is decreasing. 

For training I used the default data and default command:
`python translate.py  --data_dir [your_data_directory] --train_dir [checkpoints_directory]  --en_vocab_size=40000 --fr_vocab_size=40000` (substituting directory paths of course)

However when I try using the model by running `python translate.py --decode
  --data_dir [your_data_directory] --train_dir [checkpoints_directory]` I get the following error:

ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (1,) for Tensor 'weight5:0', which has shape '(64,)'

It looks like the script is expecting the whole batch (which is set to 64 by default) but when I type any input, it creates only 1 sample of data.

classifier = learn.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns, hidden_units=[40, 80, 40], n_classes=3, model_dir='model')

As I understood, to reuse a model I need to make 'fit' 1-3 steps. (This fact I found here in TF issues)

`classifier.fit(x_train, y_train, steps=3)`

Then when I call `predicted = classifier.predict(x_test)` , it throws an exception:

4268,resize_image_with_crop_or_pad loses channel information,"``` python
png = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad(png_raw, 100, 100)
```

before:

```
TensorShape([Dimension(None), Dimension(None), Dimension(3)])
```

after:

```
TensorShape([Dimension(100), Dimension(100), Dimension(None)]
```

`tf.image.pad_to_bounding_box` has the same problem.
The combination of these two lines seems questionable:

```
height, width, depth = _ImageDimensions(image, static_only=False)
padded_shape = [None if is_tensor(i) else i
                  for i in [target_height, target_width, depth]]
```

why set `static_only=False`? The docs for `_ImageDimensions` say:

>    list of integers `[batch, height, width, channels]`, when static shape is
>     fully defined or `static_only` is `True`.
>     list of integer scalar tensors `[batch, height, width, channels]`, when
>     static shape is not fully defined.

so unless all dimensions of the image are defined you will get tensors which will then be changed to `None`.

"
4261,PIP package contains CUDA libraries,"As discussed offline: the PIP package size has greatly increased since the `cuda_configure` change because the CUDA libraries under `external/local_config_cuda` are now being included by `build_pip_package.sh`.

The simplest fix for this is to special-case `local_config_cuda` to exclude it from being copied in `build_pip_package.sh` since there does not seem to be a way to specifically exclude all files under `@local_config_cuda//` in the `sh_binary` rule itself.

The reason why we did not experience this previously is because the CUDA libraries were symlinked under `third_party`, and `build_pip_package.sh` rsyncs `third_party/eigen3` specifically.
"
4259,Command line processor fails silently on mistyped args,"### Problem:

The command line processor doesn't raise exceptions when the existing flags that are in common use throughout TensorFlow (at the very least by convention) are mistyped. For example, let's take

```
--num_gpus
```

which is frequently encountered, e.g. in Inception v3, CIFAR-10, etc. If I type a single dash instead of two, the CLI arg processor just picks up whatever the default value is defined in my app and silently ignores the misformed CLI argument. I realize that one can't restrict the args that are supported because they are pulled from sys.argv and there may be other args passed on to the user's app code, so it's not the same level of strictness as say in processing CLI switches for Unix apps which have a fixed set of options. However, perhaps the solution is to look for small typos such as Damerau-Levenshtein distance of 1 (one deletion, insertion, substitution or transposition, with 1 transposition still treated as edit distance of 1) from the arg specified as recognizable in FLAGS that should raise an exception unless the users forces literal interpretation of the args?

4257,Move all model implementations to tensorflow/models ?,"If I am correct, tensorflow.models is being deprecated.
But some model implementations are still kept inside this directory because of tensorflow tutorials. 
I think it would be more straight forward and relevant to keep all the model implementations in tensorflow/models repository.

(This is a same issue discussed in [tensorflow/models issue 361](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/361).)

I made a [pull request](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/pull/393) that moves all tensorflow/tensorflow model implementations to tensorflow/models without losing commit histories.

I can make another pull request to tensorflow/tensorflow to fully deprecate the model implementations and update tutorials.

4256,Tensorflow in Azure ML,"I've so far seen people using tensorflow in Azure using in this [link](http://www.mikelanzetta.com/tensorflow-on-azure-using-docker.html).
Also using the advantage of ubuntu in windows tensorflow can be run on
windows pc as well.Here is the [link](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PlayingWithTensorFlowOnWindows.aspx).
However during a conversation with Windows Azure engineer Hai Ning it came out
that ""Azure ML PaaS VMs use Windows OS; TensorFlow is not supported on Windows as of now.""
Hence there is no direct way of running tensorflow in Azure ML.
Is there any work around anyone figured out that allows running tensorflow in Azure ML.

We are building an iOS app to perform image classification using the TensorFlow library.

Using our machine learning model (91MB, 400 classes) and the TensorFlow 'simple' example, we get memory warnings on any iOS device with 1GB of RAM. 2GB models do not experience any warnings, while < 1GB models completely run out of memory and crash the app.

We are using the latest TensorFlow code from the master branch that includes [this iOS memory performance commit](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/459c2fed498530b794c4871892fd68d1e6834ac6), which we thought might help but didn't.

We have also tried setting various GPU options on our TF session object, including `set_allow_growth(true)` and `set_per_process_gpu_memory_fraction()`.

Our only changes to the TF 'simple' example code is a `wanted_width` and `wanted_height` of 299, and an `input_mean` and `input_std` of 128.

Any thoughts? Is our model simply too big?

4246,tf.train.Coordinator not closing threads,"I am using a number of threads to feed training examples to a `tf.RandomShuffleQueue`, however gracefully closing the threads seems not to be working nicely. This is related to https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/2130 and [this question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36210162/tensorflow-stopping-threads-via-coordinator-seems-not-to-work) however I am wondering whether there is going to be a better way of closing the threads.

The problem is that there are pending enqueue operations when you request the threads to stop. You can force these to be cancelled using `queue.close(cancel_pending_enqueues=True)`, but then the threads raise an `tf.errors.CancelledError`. As a work around you need to surround the enqueue operation with a try/except block, however the whole process is not very elegant. I am wondering whether there are any plans to improve the process of closing the threads using the Coordinator. 

The code below illustrates a working example, however as you can see it is not a very nice solution.

``` python

q = tf.RandomShuffleQueue( ... )
enqueue_op = q.enqueue_many([self.queue_inputs, self.queue_targets])

def load_and_enqueue( ... ):

    while not coord.should_stop():
        # ...

If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in

    a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[2,2])
    b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[2,2])
    r = tf.squared_difference(a, b)

t1 = np.asarray([[1,1],[1,-5]])
t2 = np.asarray([[2,3],[4,5]])

feed_dict = {a:t1, b:t2}

with tf.Session() as sess:
     t1, t2, sd = sess.run([a,b,r], feed_dict=feed_dict)
    print(""a = {}\n b = {}\n sqared diff = {}"".format(t1, t2, sd))`

Prints result like this 

`a = [[ 1.  1.]
 [ 1. -5.]]
 b = [[ 2.  3.]
 [ 4.  5.]]
 sqared diff = [[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]]`

While if I run the same code on CPU , the result is correct 
`a = [[ 1.  1.]
 [ 1. -5.]]
 b = [[ 2.  3.]
 [ 4.  5.]]
 sqared diff = [[   1.    4.]
 [   9.  100.]]`

I'd expect squared_difference to be a perfect operation for GPU and as I tensors ""a"" and ""b"" are populated properly, it doesn't look like TF has issues getting those values into GPU

Appreciate any comments on this.

Luckily so far I've only needed the rank of SparseTensors, so sparse.shape.get_shape()[0] has worked for me, but if I pass in a shape in the sparse_placeholder constructor (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4226) I would like to be able to retrieve it with sparse.get_shape()

I add `tensorflow` as a submodule to my repository and put the following snippet to my `WORKSPACE` file:

```
local_repository(

  path = __workspace_dir__ + ""/tensorflow"",
)

load('//tensorflow/tensorflow:workspace.bzl', 'tf_workspace')
tf_workspace(""tensorflow/"", ""@org_tensorflow"")

The source of the error is clear to me: [this line](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/workspace.bzl#L3) contains a `load` call with a hard-coded path. SyntaxNet uses an older version of Tensorflow that does not contain this line. 

My question is if this is a bug or not. Is this a recommended way of organizing the project that should be compiled with Tensorflow, and if not, should it be used in Syntaxnet model? Or should I just copy the `WORKSPACE` from Tensorflow's root directory?

4213,FCNs cannot be used for segmentation of variable size images after training.,"Yann LeCun pointed,  ConvNets don't need to have a fixed-size input.
One can train Fully-convolutional network using small images, and than use the model (without scaling or cropping) and feed it with large images for segmentation.
It works right away with Keras+Theano.
If one trains the same model with TensorFlow as Keras'es backend, during application of pretrained model on image larger than the images used for training, he will get A ValueError due to tensor shape mismatch (same for manual model definition directly in TF).

The shape check needs to be disabled and the convolution layers need to work properly with variable size during model using/testing phase if the framework is to be competitive.

4205,Misleading argument name on seq2seq module,"Not really major issue, but can make lose some time.

For the functions [sequence_loss_by_example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py#L980) and [sequence_loss](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/seq2seq.py#L1026), the name of the parameter `softmax_loss_function` seems to imply that only softmax based loss are compatibles which is not true (for instance `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` works too). Maybe the name was that just to indicate the default behavior but I find it misleading.

It shouldn't be really difficult to change (as there are very few references in the repository). I can send a pull request if needed.

4203,BUG in graph_actions.py,"Hello I am using `tf.contrib.learn.Estimator` to train my model, and size of validation sample is small,(validation sample size=32, eval_batch_size=16)

I have created an EvaluationMonitor to evaluate the validation sample

```
class EvaluationMonitor(tf.contrib.learn.monitors.EveryN):
        def every_n_step_end(self, step, outputs):
            eval_results = self._estimator.evaluate(
                input_fn=input_fn_eval,
                metrics=eval_metrics,
                steps=None)
            print ""Evaluation Result: %s"" % eval_results
```

and the `eval_metrics` is is a list of `tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_sparse_recall_at_k`, `input_fn_eval` is a function to read TFRecord from file

but in the evaluation step, I always get the exception:

> File ""...../tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/graph_actions.py"", line 610, in _eval_results_to_str
>     return ', '.join('%s = %s' % (k, v) for k, v in eval_results.items())

When i looks inside the evaluate method(Line 632- Line 779) in the source of [`graph_actions.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/graph_actions.py#L632)

      try:
        while (max_steps is None) or (step < max_steps):
          step += 1
          start_time = time.time()
          feed_dict = feed_fn() if feed_fn is not None else None
          if update_op is not None:
            session.run(update_op, feed_dict=feed_dict)
          else:
            eval_results = session.run(eval_dict, feed_dict=feed_dict)
            eval_step = step

          if step % log_every_steps == 0:
            if eval_step is None or step != eval_step:
              eval_results = session.run(eval_dict, feed_dict=feed_dict)
              eval_step = step
            duration = time.time() - start_time
            logging.info('Results after %d steps (%.3f sec/batch): %s.',
                         step, float(duration),

          eval_step = step

......

 # Save summaries for this evaluation.
  _write_summary_results(output_dir, eval_results, current_global_step)

```

when my code call the function,   the `max step=2`(validation sample size=32, eval_batch_size=16) will be less than the default parameter( `log_every_steps=10`), therefore the code only can run the evaluation in the `finally` block, 

```
 ....
finally:
        if eval_results is None or step != eval_step:
          eval_results = session.run(eval_dict, feed_dict=feed_dict)
          eval_step = step
...
```

but for the metrics of t`tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_sparse_recall_at_k,` the `update_op` is not Not, which means the line

```
if update_op is not None
    session.run(update_op, feed_dict=feed_dict)
```

will alway be invoked, and the batched_data in the queue will be _empty_ when the code jump into `finally` block, therefore an exception of `OutOfRangeError` will be raised, and `eval_results` will be None when the code execute at line

```
_write_summary_results(output_dir, eval_results, current_global_step)
```

I think it is caused by the default value of `log_every_steps`, when the `_evaluate_model` method in `tf.contrib.learn.Estimator`  invoke the method in line [679](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/estimators/estimator.py#L673),

```
eval_results, current_global_step = graph_actions.evaluate(
          graph=g,
          output_dir=eval_dir,
          checkpoint_path=checkpoint_path,
          eval_dict=eval_dict,
          update_op=update_op,
          global_step_tensor=global_step,
          supervisor_master=self._config.master,
          feed_fn=feed_fn,
          max_steps=steps)

```

it did not set the value of `log_every_steps` and  the default value of   `log_every_steps` will be 10, so the exception will be raised when the validation sample size is small (or total evaluation steps is less than 10)

When I set the hyper parameter `eval_batch_size` to a small value (eg. 2, which ensure total evaluation 32/2 = 16 > 10), my code is ok

4193,CTC loss is numerically unstable for long sequence lengths,"Hi All, great work TF team, thanks for implementing CTC loss ops recently!

I've noticed that CTC loss becomes quite numerically unstable for long sequences, in the attached code that reproduces the plot from the CTC paper, sequences longer than 10,000 or so degrade the quality of the gradients quite severely.

I'm not sure what the best fix is, trying to improve the numerical stability of CTC loss calculation could help, but I have no idea how difficult this would be.

In the interim, I suppose it might be worth issuing a warning when the op is used with long sequences, or placing internal consistency checks that warn the user when CTC loss may be producing bogus outputs. Or even just improving the documentation for CTC loss so that users know that this is a pitfall.

This is also sort of a public service announcement so nobody gets burned on long sequences.

Again, great work, thanks for all your effort.

4181,Document events file format,"Hello,
In the documentation for Tensorboard, I can't find a description for the format of the events file beyond that it contains Event protobufs. Is it recordio? Are there any tools for writing event files for 3rd-party Tensorflow clients that aren't using the Python API?

4176,Why reuse default to True for loop_function() in seq2seq.rnn_decoder ?,"My question concerns the rnn_decoder() in seq2seq.

I am batchnormalizing activation maps in the loop_function(). To this end, I call the tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm() function. Like many other optionalities, it calls variables using tf.get_variable().

Ideally, you'd set reuse=None during the first call of loop_function(). That way, tf.get_variable() functions can construct variables. During second and subsequent calls of loop_function() you set reuse=True.

However, in rnn_decoder() reuse is set to True also during the first call. This doesn't allow the tf.get_variable() functions to construct variables. 

My question is: why is this so? Am I doing something wrong? Or what is the logic here?

More specifically, my loop_function is:

``` python
    def loop_function(output, i):
      ##some code##
      some_variable = tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm(some_variable,is_training= self.is_training)
      ##some code##
      return some_variable
```

I made a work-around, by defining my own rnn_decoder. I copy-paste the Tensorflow implementation and set reuse=None during the first call

``` python
def rnn_decoder_rob(decoder_inputs, initial_state, cell, loop_function=None,
                scope=None):
  REUSE=None
  with variable_scope.variable_scope(scope or ""rnn_decoder""):
    state = initial_state
    outputs = []
    prev = None
    for i, inp in enumerate(decoder_inputs):
      if loop_function is not None and prev is not None:
        with variable_scope.variable_scope(""loop_function"", reuse=REUSE):
          inp = loop_function(prev, i)
      if i > 0:
        variable_scope.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables()
        REUSE = True
      output, state = cell(inp, state)
      outputs.append(output)
      if loop_function is not None:
        prev = output
  return outputs, state

4174,tf.nn.bias_add does not support multiple derivatives (using with contrib.learn),"Apparently, `tf.nn.bias_add` does not support differentiating twice: I created a neural network with `tf.contrib.layers`, and attempting to compute a Hessian matrix (actually Hessian-vector product, based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_automatic_differentiation) yields a `LookupError` saying that `BiasAddGrad` has no gradient.

From what I understand, `bias_add` is basically `add` with support for different types.

Is there any way to allow `bias_add` to be differentiated multiple times? Perhaps at the very least we could make the use of `bias_add` optional in `layers`.

4172,Missing files and flag for building linkable archives with `make` on Linux (Ubuntu),"Trying to build under Linux, I have faced two issues, one for PIC missing, and one for a missing file in the source build list.

I guess the origin of the problem is the `Makefile` depends on Bazel's build, and changes may be missing.

How does this looks for you? Here is a temporary [patch](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/compare/master...ic:master).
### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?
### Environment info

Operating System: Linux 16_04

Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: None

If installed from source, provide 
1. The commit hash (`git rev-parse HEAD`): 461caa86137aee3d2e40843ea308c216f10c4655
2. The output of `bazel version`: It does not apply here (using `make` from the `tensor flow/contrib/makefile` project.
### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example:

cd tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf
make && make check && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
cd -
make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile

# Leading to error when building `benchmark`
```
### What other attempted solutions have you tried?

I have tried to build on Ubuntu 14_04 and Mac OS X (10.10). It worked only on Mac OS X. Then I realized that the build chokes on my Linux boxes for PIC, and then for a missing file. Adding them (see a [solution here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/compare/master...ic:master)) fixes all.

I am not sure what to try because cudnn works with Theano on this machine, it also states that it finds the GPU.

4164,Performance issue for Distributed TF,"Hi All,

We just enable distributed TF to train our model,  but we get very slow performance comparing to train on single machine. We just setup two machines one ps, one worker, and each machine is Xeon CPU with nvidia K40 GPU:
GPU 0: Quadro K420 (UUID: GPU-954fc4b7-6198-f5f9-1efb-69e73d001d5c)
GPU 1: Tesla K40c (UUID: GPU-ac243789-45bd-448f-87d9-db21c1c88c87)
GPU 2: Tesla K40c (UUID: GPU-d7b7783e-9041-e4e2-91f0-dc4188fd84e9)

If we train on one machine we can meet 200+examples/sec, but on two machines, it is just 20+ examples/sec. 10 times slower....

Our two machines are connected in 1GBits network, and we find the network bandwidth is just 40%.

Some topic discussed this issue, but I haven't got any solutions...

```

Tested on a fresh 0.10.0rc0 install, as well as in the `tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly` docker image. 

Little mystified by how this is occuring since the it's correct in source. I suspect it has something to do with everything being brought into the layers namespace.

4155,Tensorboard: Feature and/or documentation request: Viz hyper parameter set ,"(I am not sure if this is a documentation issue or a feature request.)

Running multiple studies using different hyper parameters can be difficult when more than a handful of hyper parameters are investigated over a shorter timespan. The way we done it is to show the active hyper parameter set  in an ascii string (the log directory name). 

We already have 10 or so hyper parameters and showing them all in the directory name of the plot and comparing them is simply not a sustainable workflow. Naming the log directories the same as the input file (spec. the hyperparameters) is not so good either because the researcher have to open up the file and see / remind himself what the specific hyperparamteres where set to.

I wonder what people suggests using in this workflow? Is there a efficient workflow for this that I just have not discovered yet, or is some new feature required?

4151,Memory leak when continuously run assign op,"### Environment info

Build timestamp: Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 (0)
Build timestamp as int: 0
### Problem:

In my application, I need to change value of some variable, and run the minimize in a loop, thus I have to run assign op continuously, which may add new op to graph every time, thus the program become very slow and memory explode.

```
sess = tf.Session()
a = tf.Variable(np.ones((5, 10000, 10000, 3)))
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(10000):
    sess.run(tf.assign(a,np.ones((5, 10000, 10000, 3)) ))
    t1 = time.time()
    print(t1-t0)
    t0 = t1
```

So is there a method to change the value of Variables without adding an op to graph? Or a way to remove it after(I have a big graph defined before the loop, I don't want to reset all of them and define again with reset_default_graph)?
And since the value assigned to the variable is different all the time, I cannot define the op before the for loop.

4149,Wide and Deep Learning tutorial example fails on Python 3.4,"When using the ""deep"" functionality in the Wide and Deep Learning tutorial on Python 3.4, I get the following error:

```
ValueError: Duplicate feature column key found for column: education_embedding. This usually means that the column is almost identical to another column, and one must be discarded.
```

Looks like a bug in tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/feature_column.py in the _EmbeddingColumn class. The key(self) property is plagued by this bug: https://bugs.python.org/issue24931

So instead of coming out with a nice unique key, we get the following key for all _EmbeddingColumn instances: '_EmbeddingColumn()'

This causes the feature_column_ops.py's check_feature_columns() function to determine that the second _EmbeddingColumn instance is a duplicate since they keys of all of them are the same.
### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?

I found this StackOverflow thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39249704/tensorflow-valueerror-duplicate-feature-column-key-found-for-column/ where someone had the same problem, with no answers.  So I did the debugging and answered the question.

### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)

Be in the ""tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/learn"" directory.  Patch the wide_n_deep_tutorial.py to work in Python 3 by replacing ""urllib"" instances with ""urllib.request"".  Then run it ""python3 wide_n_deep_tutorial_py3.py --train_data=train_data --test_data=test_data --model_type=wide_n_deep"", obviously replacing the train_data and test_data files with your own copies, or omitting those switches altogether to download the files fresh.
### What other attempted solutions have you tried?

I worked around the problem by creating a subclass of _EmbeddedColumn and using that, but not sure my key(self) property implementation is working because the accuracy result with wide_n_deep is worse than with just ""wide"".  You can see this in my answer to the StackOverflow question at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39249704/tensorflow-valueerror-duplicate-feature-column-key-found-for-column/39268045#39268045

4146,Provide generic android JNI interface,"In the Android example, the developer need to write some customized C++ code for the JNI call, this extra effort is not needed especially in the prototyping step.

Could we provide a generic JNI interface (just like generic inference serving, with input/output as a map of tensors, using serialized protobuf bytes or customized serialization), then the developer will not need to write and BUILD C++ code anymore.

Of course, the developers are free to optimize the code by writing the customized JNI calls. This feature will definitely boost the development process.

4138,seq2seq model is not efficient when using sampled softmax,"Hi, 
my commit number is
70de76e696c21da617fd2e6435cf7fedab220db8

I want to try sampled softmax to speed up my lm training. I'm changing slightly on the ptb training example code. I'm working on a CPU machine.
First, on ptb(vocab 10k), I'm using the ""small"" config, I see some speed up gain:
normal softmax 896wps

sample_softmax h256L1ba20 sample512 1975wps

Then, I move to a larger set, and using 100k vocab, I'm still setting the sample number to 512, I think the speed should be similar to the ptb case. But I got the speed to be about 300 wps, even if I set the sample number as small as 4. I don't understand why it should be so slower than the ptb case. Do you know how can I make it faster?

Here's some of the related code:

```
      output = tf.reshape(tf.concat(1, outputs), [-1, size])
      softmax_w = tf.get_variable(""softmax_w"", [size, vocab_size])
      softmax_w_t = tf.transpose(softmax_w)
      softmax_b = tf.get_variable(""softmax_b"", [vocab_size])

    if use_sample_softmax == True:
      loss = tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(softmax_w_t, softmax_b, output, tf.reshape(self._targets, [-1, 1]), num_samples, vocab_size) #todo
      self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size
    else:
      logits = tf.matmul(output, softmax_w) + softmax_b
      loss = tf.nn.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example(
          [logits],
          [tf.reshape(self._targets, [-1])],
          [tf.ones([batch_size * num_steps])])
      self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size

this leads to a seg fault, tested on a Mac with CPU, both with tensorflow 0.9.0 (binary release) and when compiled from source (last commit https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ad4f02a69162abe5d242b7d94f62138849aec9ab ).

For certain values of `(x_shape[–1], f_shape[-1])`, for instance (2,4) or (8,32), the seg fault occurs, but for other values (2,2) or (16,32), there is no seg fault.

Inserting some `std::cout <<` print statements in the code shows that the segmentation fault occurs during this function call in Conv3DBackpropFilterOp::Compute https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_ops_3d.cc#L315

4132,Unexpected performance changes as a function of batch size,"I am observing unexpected performance from tensorflow as I change the batch size that I feed to the session.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/966348/18139518/cfa80cc0-6fa9-11e6-9b7f-20bbfb30ddc9.png)

I have created a [small jupyter](https://gist.github.com/tillahoffmann/63cbe9fce331df75a6b57420c48b7c36) notebook to demonstrate the issue. Errors bars correspond to the standard deviation of the mean over multiple runs.

In some of our more complex models, the jump in runtime occurs at small batch sizes (around 200 images of 40 by 80 pixels).
"
4131,reduce_max and maximum give different results for negative infinity,"Using `tf.maximum` with negative inf inputs as follows:

```
tf.maximum(-math.inf, -math.inf).eval()
```

gives the expected result `-inf`

However, `tf.reduce_max`, on the same inputs:

```
tf.reduce_max([-math.inf, -math.inf]).eval()
```

gives: `-3.40282e+38` which is the min float32.

For positive infinity inputs, both functions result in `inf`.

4130,Training a neural net in C++,"1. There are examples in the repo for loading a pre-trained model in C++. Can someone add an example to train a simple 1 hidden layer fully connected neural net (or even logistic regression using SGD) in C++? 
2. I realize there is no publicly available support for auto differentiation in C++. Are there any plans to do so?

4128,Docs for Inception Model,"TensorFlow 0.10.0rc0 CPU on Linux.

This is about the Inception model and example that is included with TensorFlow:

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py

I am using this version of the Inception model:

http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz

I'm not sure whether to ask these questions here or on StackOverflow, but there are some related questions there that haven't been answered, and this is also sort of a request for improving the TensorFlow docs, so I hope it's OK that I ask the questions here.

My questions are:

(1) The softmax classifier apparently outputs an array of length 1008 - but there is only 1000 classes in the data-set. Why is there a difference? How should I adjust for this difference?

(2) What is the size of the input JPEG-images supposed to be, and is the Inception model rescaling them automatically?

(3) I get a deprecation warning. I don't know what is causing this. Does it mean that this Inception model will stop working in the future?

> /home/foo/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py:1811: VisibleDeprecationWarning: converting an array with ndim > 0 to an index will result in an error in the future
>  result_shape.insert(dim, 1)
> W tensorflow/core/framework/op_def_util.cc:332] Op BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization is deprecated. It will cease to work in GraphDef version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization().

(4) The sample code uses `tf.gfile.Exists()` which just wraps `os.path.exists()` so it seems to be completely redundant. Why is it used?

(5) The sample code also uses `tf.gfile.FastGFile()` which seems to be the non-thread-safe version of TensorFlow's file-class. Why not use Python's built-in `open()` instead?

(6) The function `run_inference_on_image()` creates a new TensorFlow session for each image that is being processed. Is the TensorFlow session so lightweight that this is the preferred way of doing it? Or is it better to create a single session and use it repeatedly?

Thanks.
