## Overview

In our pursuit to understand why researchers in Artificial Intelligence may prefer PyTorch over TensorFlow, our investigation focuses on assessing the readability of code and the seamless usability of APIs within each framework. We conducted measurements on the API density of six models implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch (client code), API usability documentation for both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and code readability of the six models implemented in TensorFlow and PyTorch (client code).

### Project Structure

```bash
Usability Functionality
├─ Data 
│  ├─ Documentation : Contains HTML and produced CSV files.
│  ├─ Models        : Holds the seven models implemented in both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
│  └─ json_packages : The most popular substring terms in APIs of both PyTorch and TensorFlow used for our code to count the number of APIs.
├─ API_Density_Metrics: Automated script for collecting the unique number of API calls in each model. Some counts were manually conducted.
│  └─ Final_Results   : Results produced from the CSV file generated by collect_Unique_API_Call.py.
├─ API_Usability_Metrics: Contains all implemented metrics used for quantitative comparison of results.
├─ Code_Readability_Metrics: Metrics on the six models.
│  ├─ model_result: Metric results for each file and average per file
│  └─ gomean_all: Uses Geometric Mean to average all files for each model if applicable.
├─ generating_resultGraphs.ipynb : Responsible for generating all graphs in this section of the paper.
├─ pytorch_html_scraper.py : Produces the PyTorch CSV file of APIs from the documentation.
└─ tensorflow_html_scraper.py : Produces the TensorFlow CSV file of APIs from the documentation.
```



## Reproducing The Results
We have three sections: (1) **API Density**, (2) **API Usability**, and (3) **Code Readability**

### 1. API Density 
Just Run the following command 
```bash
python3 collect_Unique_API_Calls.py --data_paths FolderForEachModel --json_paths Json_PackageFile --state Model_Type(TF or Torch)
```
**Generally**, you will need to get API density for each model. Just send the folder path for each model and will give you the results directly. 

### 2. API Usability 
Just Run the following command 
```bash
python3 report_results.py --data_path API_CSV_FILE
```
To produce the documentation results, run the code two times, each time you send the data_path for each csv file. 


### 3. Code Readability

TODO


#### 3) Tried different models to choose the best to predict whether issues are buggy or not.
