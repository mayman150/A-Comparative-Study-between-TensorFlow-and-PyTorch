# A-Comparative-Study-between-TensorFlow-and-PyTorch


## What is done? 
* Evolution over bugs
* Found a way to scrape the documentation for both TF and PyTorch

## What is Left? 
* Done Most of Scraping
* Reporting Results
* Start Writing for the Report: because it will take from us a lot of time to produce a good one.
