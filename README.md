# A-Comparative-Study-between-TensorFlow-and-PyTorch


## What is done? 
* Implemented ITID and Textual Coherence: Results will be in this sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8y4ic2EvjojgNXtEVq2Xu8MnBjdxj4Bf_5Li_cEFaI/edit#gid=0 over 7 models

## What is left to be done? 
* Number Of Concepts
* Understandability Score
* Try to improve over the ITID and Textual Coherence Metrics
* Peformance
* Evolution over bugs.
